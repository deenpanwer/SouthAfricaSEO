## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3B5998), evoking trust, professionalism, and stability, in line with finance and business. Darker colors perform well against a light backdrop.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#F0F2F5), same hue as the primary, lightly desaturated and bright to provide a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Purple (#800080). Chosen to be analogous, yet clearly distinct in brightness and saturation from the primary, to add visual interest.
- Clean and modern sans-serif fonts for body text to ensure readability and a professional appearance. 
- Use a consistent set of icons to represent different services, benefits, or features. Consider using icons with a subtle South African flair, such as stylized depictions of local landmarks or wildlife.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with plenty of white space to create a professional and organized appearance. Use clear section headings and subheadings to guide users through the content.
