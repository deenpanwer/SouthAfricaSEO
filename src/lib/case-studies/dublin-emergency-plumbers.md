### The Full Story

Dublin Emergency Plumbers had a solid reputation for quality work but were invisible online when it mattered most. Their website wasn't ranking for critical, high-intent terms like "emergency plumber Dublin" or "burst pipe repair near me." Competitors with stronger local SEO were capturing the majority of urgent calls, leaving Dublin Emergency Plumbers reliant on expensive, inefficient ad campaigns with a high cost-per-lead.

Our analysis revealed several key issues:
- A non-optimized Google Business Profile that was absent from the crucial Google Map Pack.
- A lack of specific, high-ranking landing pages for different emergency services.
- A Google Ads campaign that was targeting broad, non-converting keywords, leading to wasted spend.

**The Solution:**

Our team implemented an aggressive, two-pronged local marketing strategy:

1.  **Hyper-Local SEO Overhaul:** We completely revamped their Google Business Profile, ensuring it was rich with service keywords, location data, and positive reviews. We built out dedicated service pages for each type of emergency (e.g., blocked drains, boiler repair, leak detection), each optimized for specific Dublin neighborhoods like Temple Bar, Ballsbridge, and Rathmines. This created a strong network of locally relevant pages that Google could rank highly.

2.  **Profit-Driven PPC Restructuring:** We paused their existing broad-match ad campaigns and built new ones from the ground up. The new campaigns focused exclusively on high-intent, "emergency" keywords. We implemented sophisticated call tracking to measure exactly which ads were driving phone calls, allowing us to optimize the budget in real-time towards the most profitable campaigns.

The impact was immediate and dramatic. By appearing at the top of local search results and running highly efficient ads, Dublin Emergency Plumbers became the go-to service for urgent plumbing needs in their service area, turning their online presence into their most valuable source of new business.
