### The Full Story

Dublin Emergency Plumbers, a trusted name in local plumbing services, faced a critical challenge: despite their expertise, they were struggling to capture high-intent emergency calls. Their online visibility was severely limited, particularly in the crucial Google Map Pack, where competitors consistently outranked them. This forced them to rely on expensive and often inefficient ad campaigns, leading to a high cost-per-acquisition for new clients.

Our initial audit revealed several key issues:

*   **Poor Local Search Visibility:** Their Google Business Profile was under-optimized, preventing them from appearing prominently in local search results and the Map Pack for urgent queries.
*   **Lack of Targeted Landing Pages:** They lacked specific, well-optimized landing pages for various emergency services (e.g., burst pipes, blocked drains), which hindered their ability to rank for precise, high-value keywords.
*   **Inefficient Ad Spend:** Their existing Google Ads campaigns were broadly targeted, leading to wasted budget on irrelevant clicks and a low conversion rate for emergency services.

**Our Solution:**

TRAC implemented a comprehensive, two-pronged digital strategy designed to dominate local emergency plumbing searches:

1.  **Hyper-Local [SEO Optimization](/services/seo):** We initiated a complete overhaul of their Google Business Profile, enriching it with detailed service descriptions, accurate location data, and a proactive strategy for acquiring positive customer reviews. Concurrently, we developed a series of highly optimized, neighborhood-specific landing pages for critical services like "emergency boiler repair Dublin" and "24-hour plumber Ballsbridge." This ensured maximum relevance for local search queries.

2.  **Precision [PPC Management](/services/ppc):** We meticulously restructured their Google Ads account, shifting focus from broad targeting to highly specific, high-intent keywords such as "emergency plumber near me" and "burst pipe repair Dublin." We implemented advanced call tracking to precisely measure the ROI of each ad group, allowing for real-time budget allocation to the most profitable campaigns and significantly reducing their cost-per-acquisition.

**The Outcome:**

The results were immediate and transformative. Dublin Emergency Plumbers saw a dramatic increase in qualified emergency call leads, with their phones ringing off the hook for high-value jobs. Their consistent #1 ranking in the Google Map Pack for critical terms established them as the go-to emergency plumbing service in Dublin. The optimized PPC campaigns delivered a significantly lower cost-per-acquisition, turning their advertising budget into a highly efficient lead-generation machine. TRAC successfully transformed their online presence into their most powerful asset for acquiring new business.
