ac@pipeshift.ai,"wish someone could take over all these one-off llm deploys and make them self-serve, would finally free me up to chase bigger enterprise deals instead of babysitting infra all week"
allen@fridaymail.ai,"messing around debugging email workflow edge-cases because we don’t have someone who can glue agentic triage + productisation so friday stays a side-project, not our core biz."
kieran@midship.ai,"our audit platform lacks someone who knows how to stitch the ledger > document > excel flow end-to-end, so we’re stuck rebuilding the wheels every client instead of delivering “works out of box”."
naveed@anara.com,"i’m silently praying for someone who can convert our academic chaos (tons of pdfs, raw interviews, messy citations) into a reproducible engine so we stop being just a browser toy and become the research platform professors adopt."
finn@flok.health,need a person who can map our ai physio decisions into a full clinical-grade pathway + NHS procurement deck so we stop being a pilot and start being a contract.
founders@cartage.ai,"there’s no one in the team who’s comfortable turning carrier emails + tms exports + erp shipments into an autonomous logic engine, so we keep hiring ops folks instead of shipping software."
hello@useelevate.dev,"want someone who’ll take every acquired biz’s data lake, unify it into our core schema with minimal fuss, build dashboards and hooks so our PE clients can scale roll-ups instead of us manually doing migrations each time."
founders@anthrogen.com,"we need someone who can take our protein-engine outputs and craft lab pipelines + data capture flows so molecular designs don’t just stay in silico but hit the bench fast otherwise we’re research lab, not platform."
Phillip@shipoway.com,"wish someone could take over all these one-off llm deploys and make them self-serve, would finally free me up to chase bigger enterprise deals instead of babysitting infra all week"
founders@withgauge.com,keep juggling 50+ courier status codes manually because we don’t have someone who can build the unified tracking/eta system that turns all those noise signals into one margin-boosting feed.
founders@saphira.ai,"i keep getting dragged into every hardware compliance call, rewrite requirements docs, and tie things into iso standards while no one is executing the actual product vision if that clears up i can ship faster, hit industrial robot deals, and scale revenue instead of survival mode."
founders@odo.do,we’re buried drafting and redrafting government it bids across states because we don’t have someone who can turn raw rfp language + historical win data into a repeatable bid-engine that scales if that got solved we’d multiply deal flow and break out of the 1-off services trap.
founders@undermind.ai,"we’re grinding manual literature reviews, chasing citations and digging through pdfs when we need someone who can build autonomous research-pipelines that deliver ready-to-use insightsif that worked we’d win big pharma & academia contracts instead of tinkering in sandbox mode."
founders@zeropath.com,"we keep losing engineering time triaging security findings because we don’t have someone who can bake detection, patch-generation and compliance-mapping into our dev-stack if that were solved we’d go from security hustle to productised scale and unlock large enterprise pricing."
sammy@henry.ai,"the decks still sit in designers’ inboxes while i’m trying to close deal-flows we need someone who builds an engine that takes raw underwriting + comps and spits out investor-ready slides, so i can stop chasing format and start winning listings."
adria@meetelayne.com,"i’m trapped toggling between wiring up asset-feeds and fixing people’s estate docs instead of building the platform need someone who sets up the underlying data-ops so we deliver “estate tech” not just a service, and that shift lets us scale instead of stay boutique."
founders@starcloud.com,"we’re dealing with launch-pads, thermal-models and satellite-gpu inventory while no one is owning product-ops to make that compute sellable if someone solved the commercialization stack we’d go from lab to business and drive revenue instead of internal burn."
founders@typa.ai,"our voice clone and content-engine is great, but we don’t have someone who codifies our founder’s tone + community cues into a growth-machine if that machine existed we’d turn followers into paying users and stop relying on manual posts."
Nicolas@domu.ai,"we’re still manually stitching call-flows, chats and sms channels for collections instead of having someone who builds the automated omni-channel persuasion-engine we pitchedif that existed we’d flip operating cost into margin, convert at scale, and sell into banks like product not custom hustle."
founders@freestyle.sh,we still hand-deploy every new feature and manage infra quirks manually because there’s no one who thinks of “npm install feature-pack → instantly live in prod” as the baseline. if we fix it we go full stack typescript runtime company instead of tooling lab.
founders@superunit.ai,"every new client brings a different verification flow, different data schemas, and some messy edge case that breaks the agent stack. i keep patching things manually, writing test scripts, rebuilding api endpoints just to onboard one customer. there’s no one who owns the architecture that scales these verification agents without hand-holding. if someone could take the full loop data intake, edge case classification, self-healing tests and make it run on autopilot, we’d finally be able to process 100x more checks without spinning up a call center. that’s the bottleneck between us being a high-margin ai company and another service startup pretending to be one."
info@angstrom-ai.com,"our team keeps redoing wet-lab comparatives because we don’t yet have someone who builds the physics-accurate gen-ai simulation layer plus deployment-automation, so we stay in proof-of-concept and never capitalise on pharma deals at scale."
founders@furtherai.com,still manually stitching policy ingestion + audit trails + carrier intake forms because no one owns tooling that standardises across 50+ insurance clients; if solved we’d flip from custom gigs to SaaS with predictable ARR.
founders@withzimi.com,live returns & 3PL glue keep chaining onto product dev and we don’t have someone who can architect the orchestration mesh behind the scenes fix it and we break the boutique ceiling and scale global brand services.
founders@parley.so,"law-firms still drag in doc reviews, redirect templates, manual LLM prompt fine-tuning for each visa class because we don’t have someone building the “legal-agent as product” layer; fix that and we shift from time-billed service to subscription."
founders@simcare.ai,"health-system buyers ask for safety packs, traceability, batch logs and we lack someone who can build the full regulatory/clinical-ops layer on top of our ai-platform; if we did we’d become deployed standard not pilot."
founders@anglera.com,"designers, sku lists and brand integrations still fly in as chaos because we don’t have someone who builds the data-enrichment engine + schema mapper end-to-end; solve that and we go from consult to data-product."
founders@tryandai.com,"we keep prototyping voice-to-agent flows and A/B'ing niches without someone to pick one, build the full end-to-end funnel (transcript > insight > action > verification) and launch live; solve that and we monetise instead of demo."
founders@ontramobility.com,"i’m still personally chasing transit agency data-sets, cleaning route files, and hand-building scenario-models because we don’t have someone who can own the full network-design automation stack for our SaaS. if that’s solved, we’ll move from custom city projects into recurring contracts with 10+ agencies and dramatically scale our revenue."
founders@parahelp.com,support teams keep bouncing tickets between tools and our agent still can’t execute across systems without constant oversight. we need someone who understands multi-tool orchestration + agent autonomy so our “AI support teammate” actually resolves end-to-end without human babysitting solve that and we unlock true automation for 100s of fast-moving software companies.
founders@surebright.com,"every merchant integration still feels like a consulting job: sku-mapping, policy-gen, compliance per-state, custom UI we don’t have someone who systematically builds the productised “warranty offer engine” that runs automatically across merchants. if that person exists, we go from project-mode to embed-every-checkout and revenue scales horizontally."
manish@surebright.com,"i’m personally involved in product-pricing spreadsheets, risk modelling and region-by-region regulation checks instead of building growth levers i need someone who can build the end-to-end “merchant acquisition + warranty-offer launch” pipeline so we stop executing on spreadsheets and start scaling by placing ourselves at checkout."
founders@assemblyhoa.com,"we still have board-members calling us, manual reserve planning spreadsheets, and adhoc vendor billing because there’s no one who can own our internal “community ops + fintech platform” layer end-to-end when that gets solved, we’ll shift from managing 20 communities to thousands and convert our technology into predictable SaaS revenue instead of service fees."
allen@assemblyhoa.com,"i’m still in the loop on every community’s budgeting and vendor approval because we don’t yet have a fully automated backend that ties reserve planning, compliance, and payments together. once that’s owned, we stop firefighting HOA ops and start scaling into thousands of managed communities without linear headcount."
founders@useterra.com,"right now our sustainability analytics are great at reporting but not yet “decision-driving.” clients love the dashboards but they still export data to excel for action. we need someone who can turn those insights into automated recommendations otherwise, terra stays a tool, not an operating system for corporate sustainability."
founders@vibe.codes,"building the dev experience feels fragmented plugins, snippets, community feedback loops all sit in different silos. we don’t have a growth engineer who can unify that into a single flywheel where contribution, testing, and feedback flow seamlessly. fix that and vibe shifts from cool tooling to platform gravity."
founders@mdhub.ai,"hospitals still fax us lab reports to digitize because integrations with EHR systems are brittle and slow. we need someone obsessed with healthcare data plumbing HL7, FHIR, the messy real world to make mdhub’s AI insights flow directly into doctors’ workflows. do that and adoption explodes overnight."
founders@1849.bio,experiments run fast but our data pipelines don’t we spend more time cleaning assay outputs than designing new molecules. we need a systems-thinker who can automate that flow from lab instrument to model training so we can compound learnings instead of losing cycles to cleanup.
nico.laqua@corgi.insure,"i’m still reviewing every pricing file and state filing before launch that’s not sustainable. we need someone who can codify insurance logic into a dynamic risk engine so corgi can release new coverage in days, not quarters. if that’s built, we’ll out-ship legacy carriers by an order of magnitude."
founders@corgi.insure,pricing spreadsheets and state filings eat our launches; need someone who can codify underwriting logic into a runnable engine so we spin new products in days not quarters.
emily.yuan@corgi.insure,i keep redoing compliance tables and chasing regulator notes before every pilot want a single person who automates filings + testable pricing so we stop bottlenecking product releases on manual reviews.
founders@usemica.com,"we ship ai agents fast but ops still breaks daily need someone who owns enterprise plumbing (integrations, audit logs, retry logic) so customers stop returning our automations as “fragile proofs”."
founders@sorcerer.earth,"field data is noisy, sensors drift and government buyers want repeatable verifications; we need an engineer who can fuse balloon telemetry + sat imagery + ground truthing into a verifiable product that regulators trust."
austin@sorcerer.earth,syncing high-freq telemetry with low-res public datasets is a mess i want someone who builds resilient sensor pipelines and automated calibration so our weather data is defensible for insurers and govs.
founders@intryc.com,"ingestion breaks for every new partner: bad schemas, flaky APIs, and missing metadata need a specialist who creates deterministic parsing + canonicalization so our detection models stop degrading per client."
founders@mitohealth.com,"our biomarker stack produces rich signals but clinicians want prescriptive reasoning, not dashboards; need someone who binds longitudinal lab data to actionable clinical narratives and automated monitoring so users actually change behaviour."
founders@remade.ai,"creative teams send 15 incompatible pattern files and we spend weeks normalizing them; hire a data+ux engineer who standardizes inputs and stitches generative prototypes into a live sampling loop so brands get samples, not chaos."
founders@samplehc.com,"hospitals keep delivering documents in 10 different formats and our pipeline stalls under peak load want an ops person who architects FHIR/HL7 bridges, robust queuing and human-in-loop fallbacks so workflows run without triage."
founders@rastro.ai,"buyers won’t act on flags without audit trails and supplier provenance need someone who builds transparent explainability + verifiable sourcing graphs so our supply-chain signals become contractable policies, not advisory noise."
malay@pokalabs.com,we’re still manually reconciling quotes → production schedules for complex chemical SKUs because nobody on the team both understands plant ops and can productize quote-to-shipment automation; i spend days mapping edge cases for formulators and with that time gone we could close enterprise chems customers and stop selling pilot projects.
founders@pokalabs.com,"our agents can price and suggest schedules in demo but every real site has local constraints that break the flow; we need a single hire who will inventory on-site constraints, codify them into deterministic rules, and own integration with ERPs so sales motions become repeatable revenue not bespoke consulting."
dylan@cheers.tech,"ai assistants will recommend local services soon and we’re getting inbound interest from national chains, but the hard piece is stitching frontline reputation signals into a deterministic feed that the ai trusts we don’t have an engineer who can instrument field tech behavior, attach canonical metadata to every job, and prove to platforms that our signal equals quality; solve that and we own recommendation channels in every city."
founders@modernrealty.io,"buying homes is still a legal/process mess and our product needs someone who can convert the entire home purchase lifecycle into auditable, automatable flows so we can remove agent friction and offer a consistent self-service path; right now i’m firefighting title and offer edge cases instead of tuning the ML that matches buyers to houses."
founders@meetthyme.com,"advisors love our meeting notes but they still manually stitch action items into CRMs and compliance docs we need a hybrid product+compliance engineer who builds the meeting → compliance pipeline (document parsing, secure storage, auditable client consent flows) so advisors actually bill more hours and onboard clients without admin."
founders@comfydeploy.com,"artists keep sending bespoke comfyui nodes and local-only workflows; we lack the systems person who can version, sandbox and expose nodes as hardened APIs with reproducible results, model governance, and cost controls hire that person and we turn one-off creative experiments into a stable platform teams can productize."
alex@drillbit.com,"our receptionists and quoting models work great in ideal cases but fall apart across phone vendors, odd scheduling constraints, and nonstandard job types; i need an ops-engineer who understands trade workflows (estimating, materials, staffing) and can harden the whole quote, schedule, invoice loop so contractors stop needing ops employees and we sell a product that truly replaces headcount."
john@getquetzal.com,"internationalization is a thousand tiny product decisions context for strings, plural rules, cultural formatting and we don’t have the engineering lead who can build a canonical i18n pipeline (llm + human QA + CI hooks) that ships with every deploy; if we had that we’d stop being a translation vendor and become developer infrastructure."
brendan@getquetzal.com,"manual translations keep slowing feature rollouts because each locale needs validation and contextual QA; hire someone who automates in-product context capture, continuous locale testing, and rollout gating so engineering velocity isn’t halved by localization."
berni@soff.ai,"procurement inboxes, rfqs, and erp exports are a mess for every factory we visit we need a lead who can build robust connectors, normalized supplier identity graphs, and a rules engine that turns email threads into contractable quotes; if that exists we stop deploying bespoke integrations and start selling a repeatable supply-chain OS to tier-1 manufacturers."
founders@overlap.ai,"our embeddings and graph layer are powerful but messy to productize customers want unified search across their private data, yet each deployment needs custom ontology work. i need someone who can turn this into a self-serve interface that abstracts the semantic layer without losing accuracy. if that happens, overlap scales past pilots and into platform status."
founders@getpaxai.com,"we’ve built brilliant llm agents that can read any workflow doc but adoption dies on integration every team has its own ticketing, crm, and approval process. i need someone who builds a universal connector layer that lets pax drop into existing ops seamlessly. that’s how we stop being “a cool demo” and become the automation backbone."
founders@formulainsight.io,"pharma teams love our simulation engine, but experiments still get lost between bench and spreadsheet. we need someone who can weld our simulation output directly into lab instruments and eln systems so scientists never retype results. fix that and the insight loop goes from months to hours."
vardhan@firstwork.com,"we’ve nailed worker engagement but the hardest part is mapping skill, opportunity in real time across thousands of gigs. i need someone who can architect an inference graph that matches worker behavior, location, and microcredentials into dynamic job flows. solve that and firstwork stops being staffing tech it becomes the adaptive labor market."
founders@firstwork.com,"scheduling is our nightmare shifting worker availability, client urgency, and compliance constraints kill utilization. we need a systems thinker who builds an adaptive scheduler that learns from history and optimizes fill-rate automatically. when that exists, margins double overnight."
founders@riskangle.com,"risk data is everywhere pdfs, filings, satellite feeds but our models still need manual ingestion. i need someone who lives for ugly, unstructured data and can wire every global feed into a clean pipeline with traceability. when we have that, we stop chasing datasets and start selling risk foresight."
leila@stardrift.ai,"we’re building spacecraft trajectory models but verification cycles take forever because no one owns the simulation-to-hardware bridge. i need a deeply technical person who can automate validation against telemetry and make our predictions provable. with that, we can go from research code to flight software."
founders@tradeflowai.com,our trade intelligence model predicts supplier risk beautifully but real clients want integration with their erp purchase orders and logistics data which we can’t automate yet. i need someone who maps our ai insights directly into their procurement systems so decisions turn into actions. that’s where revenue hides.
founders@opslane.com,we automate devops pipelines but scaling across orgs breaks because of permissioning hell every client uses a different identity system and we spend cycles hand-wiring access logic. we need an engineer who unifies auth and policy propagation across clouds so opslane just works everywhere. that’s our multiplier.
emmanouela@acxtherapeutics.com,"our platform discovers druggable targets fast, but validation still drags we need someone who bridges our ai output with wet-lab assays and helps automate early validation loops. if that’s built, discovery speed compounds and we start owning timelines instead of waiting on CROs."
founders@acxtherapeutics.com,"ai gives us promising molecular hits every week, but validating them in wet-lab still takes months we’re bottlenecked on translating computational predictions into reproducible assays. we need someone who can merge the simulation and biology worlds, automate the feedback loop, and cut discovery time in half."
alvaro@getcodeshealth.com,"every clinic we onboard wants something slightly different custom data fields, integrations, compliance tweaks and i’m stuck between shipping a general platform or building a hundred edge cases. i need someone who can abstract clinical workflows without killing flexibility so we stop being a dev shop for every doctor."
darius@buildwithpre.com,"our users love the idea of “design → component” but real-world figma files are chaos. we need someone who can interpret inconsistent design tokens, detect hierarchy, and produce production-grade code every time. if that’s solved, pre becomes the interface compiler, not just a plugin."
founders@buildwithpre.com,"the codegen model works but scaling user projects breaks everything we lack an infra engineer who can version designs, handle collaborative merges, and keep models deterministic across updates. fix that and we can onboard big design teams instead of solo indie devs."
founders@minusx.ai,"our autonomous agents are solid in the lab but collapse when deployed across messy client environments. what’s missing is an orchestrator who can handle multi-agent dependencies, error recovery, and continuous learning. whoever builds that unlocks production-grade autonomy for us."
vivek@minusx.ai,"i keep hand-tuning pipelines because no one fully owns reliability our agents drift, memory usage spikes, and clients lose trust fast. i need a backend mind obsessed with fault-tolerant systems who can make minusx agents as predictable as software, not as moody as humans."
founders@merlinai.co,"sales teams want our ai copilots embedded in their own workflows gmail, slack, notion, whatever but we don’t yet have an integration layer that lets merlin truly live where users do. we need someone who can ship and maintain native connectors so adoption doesn’t die at the login screen."
snehak@merlinai.co,"we’ve built magic for reps but the analytics layer is still primitive; i want someone who can quantify the behavioral delta between ai-assisted vs manual workflows. with that, we stop selling novelty and start selling provable revenue lift."
founders@miruml.com,"our spatial computing sdk can build gorgeous prototypes but scaling to production reality means solving edge cases occlusion, lighting variance, hardware quirks that no one owns end-to-end. i need a low-level graphics + ml engineer who can harden miruml for shipping, not demos."
jan.damm@dataleap.ai,"i am drowning in siloed data pipelines each client’s event schema, lineage, and governance differ. i’ve been manually mapping transformations just to keep analytics consistent. we need someone who can design a universal data contract system that lets every source flow through one semantic layer with full traceability. if that happens, dataleap turns from consulting tool into data operating system."
founders@dataleap.ai,"we’re still doing custom data-source mapping for every client instead of shipping a unified research stack; consultants want instant, source-linked answers but i’m juggling ingestion issues, licensing overlaps and revision-tracking across heterogeneous datasets. if someone owned end-to-end data mesh + query-audit logic, we go from pilot to enterprise all while our platform becomes the trusted “chat+data” layer for strategy teams."
founders@clearly-ai.com,"every week our internal security backlogs spike because audits, vendor reviews and privacy impact assessments still run on manual workflows; we don’t yet have a dev who deeply understands sec+privacy rules and can embed them into intelligent bots that generate audit-ready artifacts. solve that and we cut review times from weeks to minutes, and become the backbone of compliance for fast-moving AI teams."
founders@educato.ai,"our adaptive learning models hit traction (10+ exams, thousands of users) but retention fades when implementation falls into “many exams, many formats” mess; the feature gap is someone who can build the multi-format ingestion, adaptive question pipeline and feedback loop so students keep engaging and we scale revenue per cohort instead of chasing licensing deals."
founders@retrofix.ai,"we let users automate workflows via plain-english prompts and connect 2k+ apps, but our enterprise offering breaks when workflows require conditional logic, audit logs or long-running orchestration; i need a workflow-systems engineer who can make the “no-code” layer scale into robust, repeatable automation engines so we stop being just a demo and become core automation infrastructure."
akshaysg@haystackeditor.com,"large codebases are killing developer velocity haystack’s infinite canvas + graph view is brilliant, but our biggest pain is the missing integration of telemetry, code-ownership analytics and refactor heuristics. i need someone who codes IDE internals and can embed smart metrics so instead of just visualizing code, we surface what to change next at scale."
founders@haystackeditor.com,"onboarding for dev teams still involves manual training: understanding canvas, linking nodes, mapping code flows; we don’t yet have someone who can build self-serve onboarding + onboarding analytics that scales across orgs with 1000s of engineers. crack that and we shift from niche tool to dev-infra standard."
founders@browseros.com,"we’re trying to deliver instant dev environments in the browser but cold-starts, sandbox isolation and persistent state across sessions keep tripping us up; we lack a systems architect who can build auto-scaling dev containers + resilient state sync so devs treat browserOS like their local machine, not a toy."
founders@propaya.com,"underwriting has become spreadsheet chaos: data from 3rd-party sources, PDFs, legacy excel macros, manual risk adjustments and we don’t have someone who can build the dynamic underwriting engine that ties source signals to risk score → coverage decision → pricing. once that’s built we go from consulting mode into volume product and shrink cost per bind."
founders@diode.computer,"decentralised compute sounds great until nodes drop, latency spikes, state diverges and you’re chasing edge-cases; we need a lead who lives in distributed consensus nightmares and can build fault-tolerant compute meshes so diode becomes a reliable runtime, not experimental playground."
misha.vanbeek@bayesline.com,"forecasting markets is easy until data drifts, priors change, metadata goes missing and your model silently erodes; we haven’t yet built the adaptive data-snake pipeline + retraining scheduler that ensures our forecasts remain live and accurate without a full ML ops team. fix that and Bayesline’s forecasts compound into real advantage."
sebastian.janisch@bayesline.com,"our institutional clients still wait days or weeks for custom factor risk reports because legacy analytics tools can’t recalc for their unique universe i need someone who builds the live, GPU-powered factor re-builder pipeline so we can deliver tailored risk models in seconds, converting our pricing model from project-based to scale."
founders@bayesline.com,"quant teams are drowning in vendor-black-box models they can’t tweak; we don’t yet have someone building a fully modular engine that ingests raw exposures, custom factors and client data, and instantly outputs audit-trail-ready models once that exists we move from niche tool to platform backbone."
juan@benchify.com,"even with our sdk live, dev teams still revert to manual testing because generated code fails in unique production sandboxes i need someone who wilts at nothing but chaotic edge-cases and builds the universal “code-output readiness” layer so benchify becomes standard in dev pipelines."
max@benchify.com,"we have formal-methods under the hood but marketing says “automated test generation” we lack someone who translates that into seamless infrastructure for product teams (ci hooks, feedback loops, observability) so we stop being hyper-niche and become indispensable."
founders@benchify.com,"start-ups still treat benchify as extra cost not baseline because we don’t yet own onboarding for edge cases, shadow pipelines or microservices; need someone who designs the plug-and-play integration path that dev teams hit before spreadsheets even launch."
kellylu@overeasy.sh,creating synthetic vis-data is one thing; infusing it into full agent ecosystems is another i need someone who builds the bridge between our labeled datasets and live cv-agents in production so overeasy doesn’t sit in proof-of-concept land but anchors enterprise vision stacks.
founders@emberrobotics.com,field robotics deployments require bespoke configs for each environment need someone who codifies those configs into a parametric platform so ember can ship “robot in a box” not bespoke builds.
founders@ledgerup.ai,"we’re automating audit/tracking for infra ops but the barrier is cross-cloud identity + drift detection; need someone who builds the invisible guardrail layer so ledgerup becomes the standard for infra compliance, not just a tool."
founders@zscc.ai,"in the AI risk space clients want transparency across black-box models; the core challenge is constructing a real-time audit-trail layer, data provenance + model lineage. need someone who lives in that seam."
founders@exalaboratories.com,translating algorithmed designs into validated experiments takes months; we need someone who automates the “design → crash-test-fail → refine” cycle so exa becomes discovery engine not custom contract lab.
felix@pharos.health,"every hospital we onboard hits the same wall leadership wants better safety metrics but clinical data’s buried in vendor silos; i need someone who can architect the ingestion + cleaning layer that makes pharos a real-time “quality radar,” not just a reporting tool."
matthew@pharos.health,"we’re juggling 20+ healthcare data standards (fhir, hl7, csv chaos) and can’t yet unify pipelines fast enough for pilot hospitals; need a low-ego engineer who’s obsessed with data integrity + compliance so we can finally ship the universal interface that unlocks scale."
founders@clarahomecare.com,"families love that we match vetted caregivers, but onboarding them and integrating payment, tax, insurance compliance still locks dev time; we need someone who masters both care operations + product engineering so clara scales from a local marketplace into the national standard."
founders@therentflow.com,"landlords want their rent month-in/month-out but we’re still reliant on manual underwriting and risk profiles to offer split-payments; we need someone who builds the dynamic installment engine based on tenant cash-flow and risk data so rentflow becomes automatic cash-flow for landlords, not a bespoke financing service."
Founders@networkocean.io,"the concept of underwater data-centers is bold but our deployment model still rides on land-centered ops: approvals, permits, serviceability, cooling systems all require bespoke engineering; i need someone who can bridge marine engineering + hyperscale compute infrastructure so networkocean becomes repeatable datacenter product, not one-off experiments."
founders@voker.ai,"we built voker so product teams could ship ai features in minutes without engineering backlog, but in practice every “no-code” plug-in still hits custom model tuning, endpoint performance, and monitoring gaps. our marketing says self-serve but our reality is still dealing with performance explosions and drift. we need someone who owns the full ai feature lifecycle model selection, deployment, monitoring, rollback logic so voker truly becomes the internal ai-factory, not the manual “feature add-on” tool."
founders@saldor.com,"our voice-first email coworker works smoothly for basic use cases (gmail/outlook, commute mode) but enterprises we talk to demand full context, multi-thread handling, seamless CRM / calendar / task integrations and privacy guarantees. current version still feels like a consumer novelty rather than enterprise productivity platform. we need someone who can build the “context-aware, workflow-embedded voice agent” that autosenses intent, integrates across tools and delivers measurable time savings behind the scenes."
wayne@orgorg.com,"orgorg is pitched as the suite for organizational productivity, but when companies scale past 500 people the pain becomes org-metadata chaos go-links, profiles, permission oversights, identity fragmentation, document fragmentation. i keep spotlighting features but we don’t yet have someone who sees the “org-graph + workflow + identity” as one product. once we own that meta-layer, we can anchor every enterprise’s internal network and replace 10+ vendor tools."
founders@sepalai.com,"we partner with frontier ai labs and enterprises to build gold-standard training/evaluation data, but the bottleneck is always: messy domain-specific tasks, annotation drift, ambiguous schema, inconsistent quality, and slow red-teaming loops. we need someone who integrates data-ops + model-ops + audit-trail logic so sepal isn’t just “data vendor” but the meta-platform ensuring reliable model deployment for real world. once that exists, we shift from consulting mode into build-scale mode."
founders@tryhelium.com,"we tell app companies our sdk deploys in 10 lines and our ai editor ramps paywalls fast, but the truth is growth teams still spend weeks running custom experiments, maintaining variants, analyzing results, optimizing for locale + device + user-state. we need someone to craft the “self-optimizing paywall engine” that plugs in, learns automatically, surfaces best variant, integrates with analytics and pushes live so helium becomes growth automation engine not just paywall builder."
founders@generalanalysis.com,"we can run automated red-teams and find model failure modes, but every customer still needs bespoke attack suites, prompt inventories, and explainability docs; we don’t have someone who can productize red-teaming into a repeatable, self-serve security pipeline that ships with every model deployment. fix that and we stop consulting on every rollout and become the default safety layer for enterprise ai."
founders@creativemode.net,"creative mode lets players mod games without code, but real creators hit friction: packaging, multiplayer hosting, and version compatibility across mods. we need an engineer who can own the full creator lifecycle visual mod logic editor, deterministic exports, hosting infra so creators ship stable mods that actually retain players instead of one-off experiments."
founders@vera-health.ai,"clinicians love instant, evidence-backed answers, yet integrating into emergency workflows is brutal: hospital guidelines, local formularies and real EHR context break our pipelines. we need a healthcare-data systems person who nails fhir/hl7 integration, clinical validation and on-prem privacy workflows so vera is a realtime decision layer in the chart, not another clinician side-project."
hello@aviaryhq.com,"our outbound voice agents get high engagement for banks and unions, but every enterprise requires bespoke script engineering, regulatory mapping, and legacy telco integration. we need a telecom+compliance engineer who can standardise call scripts, maintain consent/audit trails, and deploy across carriers so aviary ships as a plug-in voice channel, not a custom integration."
ed@ligo.bio,"we generate candidate enzymes with models, but moving to validated, manufacturable enzymes stalls on experiment orchestration, instrument scheduling, and assay standardisation. we need someone who can own the lab - model feedback loop (protocol codification, sample automation, assay pipelines) so leads convert to validated molecules without months of manual handoffs."
founders@thundercompute.com,"provisioning low-cost, one-click GPUs is one thing; keeping multi-gpu jobs reliable, minimizing latency and offering production SLAs is another. we need a systems lead who solves GPU virtualization, network-attached performance tradeoffs and failure-recovery so thundercompute is not just cheap dev infra but a dependable platform for production ML."
sam@writewithpumpkin.com,"pumpkin’s ai editor accelerates writing, but large teams stall in version hell collaboration, draft ownership, editorial workflow and publish analytics are half-baked. hire a product+eng who builds structured collaboration, version control and feedback loops so writers don’t just draft faster, they ship reliably and measure impact."
connect@autopallet.bot,"we’ve proven palletizing automation in brownfield warehouses, yet every new site needs custom conveyor mapping, safety overlays and vendor API glue. we need a deploy engineer who turns each site into a parametrised template so autopallet becomes deploy-once, scale-everywhere instead of a factory-by-factory integration."
founders@simplifine.com,"simplifine (orca) promises an ai engine for creators/researchers, but real workflows break when datasets, simulations and model outputs are inconsistent and UX doesn’t handle complex reproducibility. we need a data+platform engineer to standardise ingestion, preserve provenance and enable reproducible experiments so simplifine is the research-workspace devs actually adopt."
founders@joinplanbase.com,"planbase sells scheduling and credentialing to clinics but every customer has unique shift rules, credential expiry windows and cross-team dependencies; onboarding still looks like a consulting engagement. i want someone to build a rules engine + adaptive scheduler that learns constraints and automates credentialing so planbase becomes plug-and-play for health systems instead of a bespoke project."
founders@decisional.com,"i keep seeing analysts drown in 50+ data sources, powerpoint decks and private-market filings when they should be doing insight work; i need someone who builds the ingestion-to-ai-synthesis pipeline so decisional becomes “one click to ready insight” not just another data browser."

founders@getcallback.ai,"companies buy us because we automate boring ops but onboarding still looks like consulting: invoice types, pdf formats, api quirks; i want a technologist who builds the “ops automation factory” (one workflow fits many) so callback stops being bespoke and becomes the ops-ai platform."
founders@silurian.ai,"we’re training foundation models for earth simulation but the bottleneck is edge-case physics, data sparsity, forecast reliability in enterprise contexts; i need someone who specialises in large-scale simulation systems, data-drift correction and real-time predictions so silurian becomes trusted infrastructure not experimental."

founders@rowboatlabs.com,"our open-source agent IDE is clever but each customer still needs custom tool-integrations, multi-agent orchestration and monitoring; i want a dev lead who can package “build, deploy, monitor” for agents as a product so rowboat doesn’t stay a toolkit but becomes the framework for enterprise agents."
founders@azalearobotics.com,"airport baggage operations are brutal manual workflows but robots haven’t replaced them yet because every facility is custom; we need someone who builds the “robot deployment template” (layout-agnostic, safety-certified, rapid-field-install) so azalea becomes the standard for airport baggage automation not a one-off."

founders@deepsim.io,"we’re trying to replace week-long thermal and physical simulations with our ai physics tool, but every chip designer i talk to says “fine, but we’ll still run legacy fem first” the handoff from prototype to certified production is still manual and messy. i need someone who owns meshing, solver-automation and accuracy validation so deepsim becomes trusted infrastructure, not just speed demo."
founders@ultra.tech,"our robots install in hours rather than weeks and scale task types, but when we scale past the first few deployments each site still demands bespoke tooling, safety certs, fixture redesigns. i want someone who builds the “zero-integration robot deployment kit” quick install, predictable ROI, field-hardening so ultra flips from custom installs into volume automation."
david@alunadata.com,"in biomedical ai data is king, but we keep hitting walls: heterogeneous imaging, missing labels, inconsistent patient cohorts. i need someone who builds the unified data platform ingestion, cleaning, benchmarking, audit-trail so aluna (or alunadata) becomes the gold-standard dataset engine behind every ai drug/diagnostic tool."

founders@storia.ai,"we built an open-source copilot that understands whole codebases, but every team still treats it like an experiment onboarding stalls because the agent can’t surface architecture context, code ownership, or cross-repo reasoning reliably; i need someone who can own the contextual graph (repo metadata, commit history, ownership, infra links) and ship the “know-your-codebase” layer so storia stops being a toy and becomes the canonical dev copilot."
founders@palmier.io,"palmier agents run in sandboxes and write code in demos, but when we try to drop them into real repos they explode: ci breaks, flaky tests, environment drift; we desperately need an engineer who will build robust sandbox ↔ prod bridges (reproducible envs, deterministic test harnesses, safe rollback) so teams actually trust agents to ship, not just prototype."
founders@blastsec.com,"enterprises keep piloting our preventative security suite but every real rollout reveals one-off infra policies and custom guardrails; i want a security engineer who can codify corporate policy into reusable guardrail primitives, integrate them across ci/cd and cloud infra, and prove prevention at scale so blast becomes the default security gate, not an add-on."
founders@senseirobotics.com,"sensei’s value is clear: cheap, real human demonstrations for robot training. but customers still need dataset design, instrumentation and labeling workflows we don’t fully own; i need someone who can productize the whole data pipeline (teleop tooling, annotation schemas, quality metrics) so partners get clean, production-ready training sets without handholding."
founders@ideate.xyz,"our ai 3d/texturing pipeline produces stunning assets but studios choke on integration export formats, shader quirks, LODs and pipeline hooks differ per engine; we need a graphics engineer who standardizes outputs (glTF + engine pipelines, texture packing, baked lighting options) and builds CI for asset pipelines so ideate becomes the go-to studio tool, not a creative toy."
founders@capitol.ai,"we’re promising “turn any document-pool into high-quality narrative” with capitol but actual enterprise clients choke when we hit dirty data, mixed formats and versioning issues; i need someone who builds the full production pipeline ingestion, semantic linking, report-generation, audit trails so we become the default “internal research engine” at companies, not just a demo."
founders@joinpap.com,"our refund-agent for shopping drops in nicely for consumers but scaling means tackling edge-cases: subscription changes, regional tax laws, merchant disputes. i need someone who builds the enterprise-grade refund automation stack workflow logic, integration with merchant APIs, compliance layer so pap! becomes the background earning-machine for every shopper."
founders@autumnlabs.io,"we built “datadog for factory robots” but when customers roll out across dozens of cells the data chaos takes over different robots, protocols, schema drift, missing telemetry. i need someone who can standardize instrumentation, build self-healing data pipelines and deliver real-time insights across factory scale so autumn becomes the operational nerve-centre, not another dashboard."
founders@zoaresearch.com,"we believe forecasting should scale across domains, not stay in narrow silos, yet right now our models still need heavy human tuning and domain-specific feature engineering. i need a systems-mind who builds the meta-model layer, configures cross-domain datasets, automates feature search and benchmarking, so zoa becomes the generic forecasting engine, not just fund-alpha in one asset class."
founders@getpathpilot.com,"we sell the fastest way for fintech/finance teams to launch ai agents, but onboarding still drags because each client has different intake forms, documents, risk controls and compliance triggers. i need someone who builds the “finance-agent factory” configurable pipelines, policy templates, audit logs so pathpilot becomes plug-and-play across banks and markets, not a consulting project each time."
founders@biocartesian.com,"we can image 50x more molecules than current tools, but pushing that into drug discovery pipelines means building the data architecture, validation workflows, and integration with pharma systems and we don’t yet have someone owning that. i need someone who builds the “molecular map actionable insight” layer so biocartesian becomes the standard dataset engine for next-gen therapeutics."
hello@magicode.ai,"our ai code-assistant can write, review and push frontend code, but teams hold back because they fear bugs, regressions and long-tail maintenance. i need someone who builds the “trusted code-agent platform” test harnesses, observability, versioning so magicode becomes the assured partner dev teams rely on, not just a helpful sidekick."
founders@focusbuddy.ai,"our ai productivity coach works for individuals, but scaling into teams and organisations means handling workflows, collaboration, context-switching, and accountability at scale. i need someone who builds the “team focus engine” embedding voice-first sessions, analytics across tasks, behavioural nudges so focusbuddy becomes the productivity backbone, not just a personal app."
charlie@conductor.build,"we’re building tools for dev teams to manage build/infra pipelines, but each enterprise has unique stack, tooling, permissions. i need someone who can build the abstraction layer across CI/CD, dev infra, monitoring, so conductor becomes the default orchestration layer, not a custom project."
jackson@conductor.build,i’m still personally on calls trying to map our dev-infra to client environments instead of building the core product. we need a systems engineer who can build the “universal dev-infra integration layer” so we stop being service-heavy and become self-serve for dev orgs.
founders@ficra.ai,"i keep getting pulled into support threads and product audits because ficra can’t yet surface architecture context and ownership across hundreds of screens need someone to build the living product-graph (commits, ownership, a/b links) so we stop being a manual QA tool and become the team’s single source of truth."

Daniel@unsloth.ai,"we ship open-source kernels and rl tooling that people love, but when teams try to scale training their configs explode memory patterns, fsdp configs, vllm incompatibilities i’m tired of answering the same infra bug tickets; we need a systems lead who can harden multi-gpu training, reproducible builds and deployable kernels so unsloth goes from research code to industry-grade training infra."
founders@hireseals.ai,"wholesalers tell us “this saves time” but integration across erps, phone channels and legacy order flows breaks pilots; need someone who can productise ai-employees into reusable connector templates and rigorous reconciliation so customers treat seals as core ops, not an experiment."
founders@et-al.io,"we aggregate papers and newsletters into biteable insights, but users want cited, updatable feeds tied to their own sources; we need an engineer who builds persistent source linking, dedupe and update propagation so et al becomes a live research feed not a static digest."
evandro@getcho.app,"delivery reliability is our product but fleet noise (late scans, ghost drivers, unstructured driver notes) means we spend engineering cycles firefighting exceptions; want a data-ops person who normalises telematics + proofs and builds automatic reconciliation so getcho’s reliability signal becomes rock-solid."
mike@getcho.app,look we nailed the white glove customer service its amazing people love jack and the team but i just cannot scale our courier supply fast enough every new city every new micro-market its a grind to onboard and train the right reliable drivers without that our delivery radius stays too small and were missing out on tons of latent demand if we could just automate or massively accelerate a high-quality driver acquisition pipeline we could actually take this thing national and leave the competitors in the dust
jack@getcho.app,my biggest time sink is still on the support side even with the ai tools we have we spend too much manpower managing edge cases and exceptions to keep that a-plus personalized service if i could implement a truly robust ai ops layer that anticipates and auto-resolves like ninety percent of those unique pickup and drop-off issues it would free up the human team like me to focus on the strategic stuff and let us truly scale without service degradation its killing our margins
founders@camfer.dev,the ai cad is magic its a paradigm shift but the model struggles with truly complex assemblies and feature trees when a customer gives us a super gnarly real-world industrial design prompt the ai precision drops or it gets stuck in local optima we need an engineering breakthrough a way to consistently handle multi-step parametric dependencies and deliver manufacturable cad models like a veteran engineer would without constant human correction thats the bottleneck for enterprise adoption
andrew@voideditor.com,were open source and the code is great but building a thriving contributor and extension community is way harder than writing the code itself we need a system a framework a series of killer low-friction integrations that gets the best devs to constantly build on top of void and contribute back right now adoption is good but the network effect is slow i need to pour jet fuel on the ecosystem growth so void becomes the default platform not just an alternative thats the only way to beat the closed-source giants
mathew@voideditor.com,we give away the core value for free which is necessary but im having trouble finding the right monetization levers that dont alienate our open-source base our pro features for enterprise teams like self-hosting and specific security controls are a hard sell because the free tool is so good we need to clearly define and market a high-value paid layer that enterprises must have for compliance or efficiency without crippling the open-source product its a tightrope walk and getting the pricing and packaging right is stopping us from having real revenue traction
carter@supercontrast.com,we have a powerful platform for deploying and finding the best ml models but were still figuring out the one key vertical that makes us indispensable right now were a little bit everything to everyone and that means no one tells their friends they must use supercontrast we need to laser-focus our offering on a specific industry or problem like a truly unique ai deployment challenge and then own that market i need to identify and dominate that first beachhead to unlock the viral growth thats not happening with a generalist pitch
shravan@supercontrast.com,my biggest frustration is that to keep the platform truly cutting edge and support all the different models our customers want i need more top-tier machine learning engineers who also get platform engineering its almost impossible to hire for both these unicorns are expensive and slow to onboard this slows down our feature development and our ability to onboard new complex customer use cases we need a systemic way to augment our internal ml expertise either through better tooling or a unique hiring pipeline because my small team is maxed out
founders@edgedive.com,the problem is not collecting the customer feedback our ai does that great the problem is the accuracy and reliability of the automated actions we take based on that feedback our ai agents are almost good enough to auto-tag pull requests and send automated comms but that last mile of accuracy is missing and makes me nervous to turn it fully autonomous if i could perfect the semantic association between a customer's vague complaint and a precise code fix or a product update it would be a game changer that's the final hurdle to a truly zero-touch customer intelligence loop
pear@trypear.ai,look we have insane free usage people love the ai autocomplete and they're using our tools but im scared to death of the monetization cliff moving from a viral product loved by individual developers to a product that enterprise ctos will actually pay for that requires a whole different level of security compliance and feature set like vpn access and sso that we havent built out yet if i cant figure out how to transition those free users to paid teams without them revolting our runway is going to vanish the model is perfect but the business model is the bottleneck right now
onkar@apolink.space,we are building breakthrough tech for the defense and space sectors but the sales cycles and compliance requirements are absolutely brutal getting that first big government or aerospace contract takes forever the paper work the certifications the security clearance it all kills our momentum im struggling to find a way to parallelize this bureaucratic slog so we can focus on rapid iteration instead of waiting a year for a yes if we could streamline that procurement path wed be scaling exponentially right now
founders@sandra-ai.com,the biggest problem is two-fold first the ai conversational reliability needs to be virtually flawless because if the ai receptionist messes up an appointment booking or a price quote we lose a customer forever and second the integration with these old dealership management systems dms is a nightmare they are all custom and clunky and it takes our top engineers too long to build a reliable two-way sync if we could solve the dms integration issue at scale we could onboard hundreds of new dealerships a month
dexter@humanlayer.dev,the core technology of autonomous agents is still too brittle our biggest roadblock is designing the intentional context engineering framework that prevents agents from hallucinating or going off-script i know how to build a basic agent but scaling it to production grade where it never screws up is a huge leap and requires a breakthrough in how agents handle long-term memory planning and tool use i need an expert system to manage the context layers more effectively before i can confidently sell it as a reliable cow-orker agent
founders@astrix.health,we have the ai to transform healthcare data but the regulatory compliance is suffocating our speed hipaa sock 2 the various state laws every single data flow every single ui change needs a compliance review or audit we are spending eighty percent of our time on legal and security architecture instead of product development we need a fast secure compliance layer that abstracts away this regulatory complexity so our engineers can just build and not have to be compliance experts too that is the single biggest brake on our growth right now
andrew@curocharging.com,my focus is on network growth and the fragmented nature of the ev charging network data is a huge pain every cpo uses a different api standard or a custom data feed and the reliability of that data is variable it takes a massive amount of engineering time just to normalize the data so our customers can rely on the network we need a universal data ingestion and normalization pipeline that can handle hundreds of different protocols seamlessly without breaking our small team is constantly firefighting data pipeline issues instead of building new features
kieran@curocharging.com,our product is ready for prime time but securing those first five whale fleet customers is proving to be a massive hurdle they are slow to move they have complex existing systems and they need months of proof of concept to trust us with their entire ev transition im spending too much time on custom integration demos and not enough on sales we need a specific playbook or an evangelist who deeply understands fleet operations and can sell a complex technical solution at the c-suite level that lack of high-level enterprise sales momentum is whats holding us back
veronica@lingo.dev,the core value prop is automated translation but we cant achieve true context-aware localization without a final human check especially for technical or nuanced marketing copy this friction in the loop slows down adoption and gives our competitors a small opening i need an ai agent that can intelligently predict and correct context errors with near-zero false positives essentially an ai editor that can replace the final human proofreader that breakthrough in nlp and deep context understanding is what will let us truly eliminate the human in the loop and scale to ten times the number of languages
max@lingo.dev,we started with dev teams and the localization tools for code are solid but my ambition is to own the entire localization stack for product marketing and code the problem is that selling to a product manager or a marketing vp requires a totally different set of integrations like figma or the crms that our current system doesnt fully support i need a fast reliable way to build out an ecosystem of non-developer integrations that makes lingo the default choice for the entire company not just the engineering team
founders@durate.com,"The bottleneck is the first contract friction. We have a bulletproof solution for a multi-billion dollar industrial problem, but these large customers demand 18 months of pilot data and every ISO certification under the sun before they sign. We need a mechanism to financially de-risk the pilot phase for them so we can accelerate from proof to production without dying of old age."
kirthi@attimet.com,"Look, the model performance is the edge, but our real bottleneck is infrastructure iteration speed. Every time we have a new trading hypothesis, it takes an insane amount of time to deploy, test in simulation, and move to live. We’re competing with titans who can spend millions on a single millisecond. I need a declarative, almost magic infrastructure layer that cuts the model-to-market latency from days to hours, or we lose our edge, no matter how good the AI is."
xiaoyu@attimet.com,"My stress is model fragility and overfitting specifically the concept of ""concept drift"" in complex, dynamic systems like options markets. We predict stuff, but the market changes its mind every hour. A model that was profitable last month is bleeding money this month. We haven't built a robust, automated feedback loop that intelligently retrains and adapts our temporal AI before the profit curve starts to drop. Right now, it's too reactive."
founders@embercopilot.ai,"Our mission is to save surgeons from paperwork, but to do that, our AI can't make any mistakes especially with billing and procedure notes. The single biggest struggle is getting the AI to differentiate between necessary context and background noise in a fast-paced OR environment. We're great at the what, but we need to nail the why and the how for compliance. The final 5% accuracy the domain-specific linguistic precision is consuming 95% of our ML budget and time. We need a better way to ground the LLM in real-time, low-latency clinical data to eliminate the need for human review."
founders@cekura.ai,"We nailed the auth and security for startups it’s fast, reliable, and production-ready. Our current bottleneck is bridging the chasm into mid-market enterprise sales. They don't care about our speed; they care about custom sso integrations, audit logs, and complex rbac that is painful to configure and maintain for them. We need to turn that enterprise complexity into a one-click, no-code experience or we will hit a ceiling on customer size."
team@alexcodes.app,"The big models like gpt-4 or claude will always be outdated on the latest iOS apis and swiftui updates that's our moat. But, training our own model on the proprietary Apple documentation is an expensive, continuous, and highly specialized problem. It’s not just data volume; it's the quality and the freshness of the corpus. Our growth bottleneck is the capital expenditure and engineering required to constantly fine-tune and release a state-of-the-art iOS LLM that's guaranteed to be current with the new Xcode/iOS versions, every time. We need a way to streamline the iOS knowledge ingestion pipeline to make it nearly free."
founders@getgait.com,"We analyze human movement, but the sheer noise and variability in sensor data from consumer devices watches, phones, rings is destroying our model reliability. Every manufacturer outputs data differently, and the sampling rates are inconsistent. We’re dedicating too many engineering cycles to data cleaning and normalization instead of feature extraction. We need a robust, physics-informed data validation layer that can abstract away the hardware mess and guarantee the quality of the gait data before it hits our ML pipeline. Bad data is our growth killer."
gecko@gecko.security,"We are the only platform that validates vulnerabilities with a proof-of-concept exploit and generates a fix. The challenge isn't finding the bug; it's guaranteeing that the automated fix is production-grade and doesn't create a new zero-day. This requires a multi-agent system that can not only write code but also reason about the downstream effects of that code on the entire repository. The current bottleneck is the speed of this high-assurance code review loop. Until we can execute that fix/verify loop in under 5 minutes on a large codebase, we can't fully automate security remediation for enterprise, which is our end game."
founders@usesynth.ai,"Our growth is capped by market education and the 'trust' factor of synthetic data. Every potential customer wants to know: is this data statistically valid? How can I prove it? We don't have a standardized, easy-to-read audit report or a certification framework that automatically demonstrates the fidelity of our synthetic datasets against their real-world counterparts. Selling this requires our founders to be in every meeting. We need to productize the trust mechanism so our sales team can close deals without a data scientist on the call."
gray@beerme.world,"The 'BeerMe' concept got us initial viral lift, but now we're 'Charm,' aiming for universal, normie-friendly payments, and the crypto friction is the roadblock. Users still have to deal with wallets, gas fees (even if abstracted), and the complexity of usdc. Our bottleneck is the cost and complexity of a fully fiat on/off-ramp system that makes a user feel like they're just sending cash, not crypto. We need a regulatory and banking solution that allows us to be a truly invisible infrastructure layer, or we stay a niche social gift app."
noah@beerme.world,"Liquidity and psychological friction at the fiat on/off-ramp. The crypto rail (USDC) is the technical advantage (global, instant, free), but the ""last mile"" of utility is where users churn. A casual user doesn't want to think about ""USDC,"" they want to send an $8 beer. Every step required to turn their bank account USD into usable USDC and then back out (wallet setup, KYC, gas fees, exchange friction) kills the ""fun"" viral loop. The technical/growth challenge is building a seamless, compliant, and near-instant fiat on/off-ramp that is totally invisible to the casual user, making the 'crypto' part an internal implementation detail, not a user step."
team@usemoonshine.com,"Our growth is capped by dark-market customer acquisition. We built a tool for a subset of engineers who won't share their workflow on Twitter, and whose companies prohibit using our solution. We need a viral mechanism that thrives on private, encrypted word-of-mouth, not public case studies. Getting those first 100 quiet users is harder than building the product itself."
founders@revyl.ai,"It’s vendor lock-in, disguised as ""unified observability."" Large enterprises already have their Honeycomb or Datadog bills locked in, and even if we’re a 10x better debugger, they see us as an additional tool, not a replacement for their core stack. We're fighting a budgeting battle, not a feature battle. We need an integration strategy that makes us a zero-setup, cost-saving layer inside their existing system, not a new column on a spreadsheet."
founders@issen.com,"Our operational overhead is eating our gross margin. We've optimized the core algorithm (compute/latency) to an inhuman level, which is our edge, but the brittle, manual DevOps required to maintain that extreme optimization for every new customer is stalling deployment. The moment the founders have to provision a new instance, the company stops growing. We need to automate the hyper-specialized infrastructure deployment to achieve true operational leverage."
founders@raycaster.ai,"Platform expansion is a trap until the network effect is undeniable. We're a phenomenal Mac utility, but every second we spend porting to Windows or iOS is a second we don't spend deepening the core Mac utility into an indispensable productivity OS. The pressure to be 'multi-platform' is diluting our focus on the only thing that makes us sticky: being the single source of truth for the desktop knowledge worker's state."
trevor@ctgt.ai,"We can't prove hallucination elimination scales to $1B datasets with the current infrastructure paradigm. We've proven the theoretical model, but deploying the ""trust guarantee"" layer for a Fortune 500 company's entire data warehouse requires a completely novel, $10M GPU allocation. Our current challenge is engineering a 'trust stack' that is 10x more compute-efficient at enterprise scale without compromising the mathematical proof of reliability."
cyril@ctgt.ai,"Compliance is a moving target that outpaces our iteration speed. We guarantee 99.999% reliability, but every new regional AI Act (EU, US) introduces subtle, new algorithmic bias definitions we have to guardrail against. The legal ambiguity forces manual, expensive audits. We need to turn regulatory text into code instantly an LLM-to-compliance-pipeline or we'll drown in the cost of remaining enterprise-compliant globally."
will@tryforerunner.com,"The speed of the founder is limited by the bureaucracy of the customer. We have 18 months of technical innovation that the prime contractors need, but a single contract takes 12 months to clear security/legal/budget. We're burning cash solving a $100M problem for customers who can't pay for it for a year. We need a strategic channel a small, agile integrator or a non-traditional defense partner that can buy and deploy our tech in 30 days to generate proof of work now."
yash@tryforerunner.com,"Achieving 'Flight-Critical' AI Trust without a decade of legacy data. Our AI is innovative, but the defense/aerospace customer will not entrust life-or-death systems to a small startup's model unless it has an unimpeachable verification process. We are constrained by the speed of regulatory certification and the volume of 'failure-mode' data needed to prove 99.999% reliability in extreme conditions. The technical challenge is building an AI-driven synthetic environment/digital twin so accurate and verifiable that the customer (e.g., DoD) accepts simulated data as a direct substitute for years of costly, physical flight-testing data. We need to short-circuit the decades-long trust process."
kesav@bookmyflight.ai,"We're being throttled by the legacy GDS/airline APIs. Our front-end is 10x faster than anyone else, but the minute we hit the actual booking layer, we're back in the 90s. The process is slow, the failure rate is high, and the financial cost of a clean, guaranteed booking is brutal. We need to build a 'synthetic' transaction layer that can reliably complete the booking faster than a human, overcoming API failures and latency, or we're just a beautiful veneer on a terrible system."
founders@galini.ai,"The perception of our product is that we're an unavoidable cost center (compliance/insurance), not a revenue accelerator. We eliminate multi-million dollar fines, which is a great talking point, but executives aren't rushing to buy a 'cost reducer.' We need to prove that our compliance layer allows them to safely ship new AI features 10x faster than their competitors. Our growth is dependent on reframing compliance as a competitive advantage in iteration speed."
hello@scrapybara.com,"The marginal cost of an action is too high to run complex, long-chain agents. Every 'click' or 'type' action requires a new LLM call, a screenshot capture, and a round-trip to the GPU. This makes complex, multi-step workflows (like ""check inventory in Salesforce, then draft an email in Outlook"") prohibitively expensive and slow. We need a low-cost, local ""micro-LLM"" or visual parser running on the remote instance to close the perception-action loop and drive down the per-action cost from dollars to cents."
daryl@andoria.ai,"The jump from 'compelling demo' to 'unattended production utility' is where we die. Our agent can perform incredible tasks with a human watching, but the moment we take the human out of the loop, the agent fails on edge cases 5% of the time. That 5% failure rate is a 100% blocker for enterprise adoption. We need a robust, real-time self-healing and self-verification loop that allows our agents to audit and correct their own errors in milliseconds."
Vignesh@innate.bot,"Bridging the 'Sim-to-Real' gap for physical manipulation is the limiting factor on our data collection. We can simulate millions of tasks, but the real world always breaks the model (slippery surfaces, object placement variability). We need a high-fidelity, high-throughput, real-world data flywheel. Our growth depends on getting builders to not just use Maurice, but to passively or actively generate the clean, labeled physical interaction data that will train the next, truly general-purpose AI brain."
axel@innate.bot,"We're accidentally building a B2B product when the vision is consumer. Our first users are high-end builders, but the path to a mass-market personal robot is blocked by the $10,000 unit cost and the complexity of the ""open platform."" We need to identify and isolate the single, cheapest 'killer app' function (like 'unload the dishwasher' or 'fold the laundry') that justifies a sub-$2,000 price point and a plug-and-play consumer experience."
founders@hybrd.app,"Look, we know our product is better it's the only place a hybrid athlete can truly blend their strength, running, and cycling data to get a meaningful AI-driven performance score. The problem is, we are hitting a ceiling on high-value user acquisition. We need a better flywheel than just social media ads. The users who get the most value from us are those already paying for multiple other fitness subscriptions and using a WHOOP or Garmin. They are the whales, but they're hard to reach efficiently. We need someone who can design and execute a high-leverage partnership strategy with a major fitness tracking hardware company or a premium training content provider (like a specialized marathon or lifting program) so that we become an immediate integration/feature for their existing, already-paying user base. We just can't afford to acquire them one by one."
jonas@karmenai.com,"The core tech is solid: our AI reads messy construction docs, emails, and drawings to automate scheduling and data entry for project managers. It’s saving them hours. The killer bottleneck is enterprise sales velocity. Construction companies are slow to adopt and the decision-makers (usually a VP of Operations) won't sign on an annual contract without proof-of-concept on a real, multi-million dollar job site. We need to reduce the time-to-value from 90 days to 30 days. We need a product and sales process specialist who can figure out how to onboard a customer's documents, run a rapid, value-proving pilot, and get a referenceable case study signed before the customer has a chance to drag their feet for a quarter. We have the tech; we need to unlock the enterprise funnel speed."
parth@trycandle.app,"We built an app for couples and friends to stay closer with a 5-minute daily ritual. It works retention is high for active users. But for a consumer social app, our biggest problem is the 'second user' friction and the viral coefficient. We are a network product, yet we have to onboard the primary user and then convince their partner or friend to download and commit to the daily ritual for the connection to happen. The drop-off in that second step is huge. How do we create a zero-friction, incredibly compelling asymmetric value proposition for the secondary user? Maybe it's a piece of content, a gift, or a micro-game they can play before they even need to download the full app. We need a creative growth hacker who specializes in two-sided network incentives."
alex@trycandle.app,"Our biggest challenge, and the one keeping us up at night, is a pure network effect acquisition hurdle. Our product, Candle, only works if two people a couple or two friends commit to the daily 5-minute ritual together. The primary user signs up and loves the concept, but the moment they invite their partner/friend, we see a massive drop-off. We need to cut the friction on the invite and activation process for that second user. Currently, we’re essentially forcing two distinct behaviors (a download and a daily habit) for one value proposition. We are struggling to create a compelling, low-friction, and asymmetric value incentive for the person who is simply being invited."
founders@lighthouz.ai,"We are automating the chaotic back-office of freight finance (invoices, rate confirmations, etc.) with specialized AI agents. Our challenge is translating world-class AI research into a highly trusted compliance product. Because we're dealing with financial audit trails and risk, accuracy isn't just a feature, it's a legal requirement. We need to go from 'Srijan's amazing LLM' to a formal, certifiable, and demonstrable ""Explainable AI"" compliance framework that a CFO or regulator can sign off on. We need a Head of Product/Risk who can build the governance layer the monitoring, the audit logs, and the 'human-in-the-loop' exception handling that turns our platform into an institutional-grade, zero-liability solution."
srijan@lighthouz.ai,"Our technology for freight finance is groundbreaking our AI agents automate the messy back-office processing of invoices and rate confirmations, which is a compliance nightmare in a $10 trillion industry. We have the technical accuracy, but our sales cycle is getting blocked by the trust barrier of institutional customers (CFOs, risk officers, and regulators). They look at us and see a 'black-box AI,' not a certified audit tool. The problem is the lack of an institutional-grade, formal governance framework that sits atop our core LLM. We can't scale until we can formally prove, in a way that satisfies an auditor, that our AI is explainable, auditable, and non-discriminatory across all financial documents. We need to productize trust."
mathgptpro.info@gmail.com,"We have built the best math problem-solving AI on the market. But our user base is stuck in a highly-engaged but small segment of college students. We cannot break into the K-12 institutional market. Schools, districts, and large tutoring centers move slowly, and they demand clear evidence of learning outcomes, not just cool tech. Our problem is that we don't have the internal expertise to design and run the necessary large-scale efficacy studies and pedagogical white papers that school boards and superintendents require. We need a Director of Education Strategy and Research to create the proof that our product is the teaching tool, not just a cheating tool."
info@astromecha.co,"Our core AI is designed to dramatically accelerate biology but the data silos are insane. We can’t just vacuum up all the bio data on the planet. The central challenge is data standardization and integration. We need to develop a universal, highly secure federated learning architecture to train our models across proprietary, air-gapped datasets (like from Pharma or research institutions) without ever seeing the raw data. This is a novel, high-security engineering problem we need a lead architect on yesterday."
ben@kscale.dev,"We’re building the world’s lowest-cost humanoid robot hardware to make the software the real moat. But to get the community flywheel going, we're struggling to build a compelling developer ecosystem. Right now, the effort required for an external developer to code a new skill for our robot is too high. It takes an expert. We need a Developer Relations (DevRel) Lead/Platform Engineer to build a standardized, open-source SDK and create the initial, easy-to-digest tutorials and tooling so that thousands of hobbyists and university labs can start building skills for our 'Stompy' robot without needing to be PhDs."
founders@tokenowl.ai,"We're a small, sharp team building a critical tooling product for the next wave of Web3 apps. Our product is highly technical, and our customers are other developers/CTOs. Our problem is simple: our pricing model is confusing and preventing us from moving upmarket. We charge based on token volume, API calls, or some combination, and every customer tries to negotiate a bespoke deal. This kills our gross margin and forecasting. We need a VP of Strategy/GTM to come in, benchmark the market, and implement a clear, defensible, and standardized value-metric pricing strategy that scales transparently from small dev teams to large, funded enterprises."
hello@rysemarket.com,We're a specialized marketplace but customer lifetime value (LTV) is too low to support profitable paid acquisition. We need a deep dive on post-acquisition user experience.

team@keywordsai.co,"We give AI startups the tools to monitor their LLMs in production. The technical buy-in from CTOs is there. Our challenge is demonstrating immediate ROI to the CEO/CFO. Monitoring is seen as a cost center, not a profit driver. We need to hire a Sales Engineer who is excellent at storytelling and can build the pitch that shows how using our monitoring platform directly prevents a $X0,000 model drift event or uncovers a $Y0,000 cost-saving opportunity, effectively turning our software into an insurance policy or a P&L booster."
founders@withaqua.com,"We have a strong product, but frankly, we're hitting a founder-led sales wall. I, the CEO, am doing 90% of the deals, and my calendar is swamped. This is crushing our ability to focus on strategy and fundraising. I need to hire my first Head of Sales/Sales Leader who can take over the entire mid-market pipeline, hire two new reps, and implement a scalable, repeatable sales playbook based on my current process. It must be someone who can both sell and build the machine."
tyler@openfoundry.ai,"We're building this great platform for developers working with specialized, open-source AI models. The developers love us, and our Slack community is humming. But this doesn't pay the bills. We have zero revenue. None. The problem is pivoting from a widely-loved free tool to a widely-used paid platform without alienating our core community. We need a Product Leader who is an expert in open-source monetization someone who can design a 'friendly' freemium tier, a value-add enterprise layer (SLA, security, governance), and a commercial license model that the community accepts as fair and the business can actually scale on. We're running out of runway to figure out how to monetize the value we've already created."
founders@raindrop.ai,"The tech is proven we're integrating with huge institutions like Aegon and finding hundreds of millions in lost pension pots. That works. But the next stage of our product roadmap, moving from a B2B tracing tool to a B2C engagement platform for the end user, is stalled. We are great at backend data matching, but terrible at consumer-facing design and behavioral science. We need someone to design the actual gamified engagement loops to convert a passive user who 'found their money' into an active user who 'manages their money' within our partners' apps. That is a pure, high-stakes consumer product challenge."
q@newmoneycompany.com,"Our product is invoice insurance. We guarantee payment to small businesses, which de-risks their cash flow massively. The founders are former revenue and engineering leads from Hologram.com, so we know how to sell and build. Our problem is underwriting speed and data access. Right now, the process to underwrite a new buyer takes too many manual data pulls. To scale from hundreds to thousands of invoices daily, we need a CTO/Lead Data Scientist to build a proprietary, real-time, algorithmic credit-scoring model. This person must figure out how to ingest and process unconventional, noisy third-party financial data feeds (like shipping manifests, logistics tracking, customs data) and bake the risk decision into the API in under two seconds. The core tech is the underwriting."
reuben@newmoneycompany.com,"Our current credit-check process is too slow and manual. The engineering problem is building a real-time, algorithmic underwriting API.

We need to drastically cut our risk assessment time to secure high-volume enterprise clients. We need a VP of Data Science to deliver the model that unlocks rapid sales velocity.
founders@eggnog.ai,"We are killing ourselves on infrastructure costs. Specifically, GPU time. Everyone talks about the model, but for us, the bottleneck is efficient inference scaling. We need to get smarter about resource allocation. We are burning capital because we can't reliably predict and schedule the compute needs for our various AI agents. It's too bursty. We need an MLOps Engineer to implement an aggressive, custom auto-scaling strategy on our cloud provider something beyond the standard Kubernetes setup to minimize idle GPU clusters. We need to cut our monthly compute bill by 30% in 90 days."
founders@lytix.co,"We’re the Datadog for LLMs. Our product is for developers building AI apps. They get that they need us. But the market is getting noisy. Our challenge isn't product, it's positioning the pricing to capture value from both the 'early dev' and the 'scaling enterprise.' Our free tier is too generous, and our enterprise tier (which saves clients tons of money on prompt engineering and model drift) is too complex to sell. We need a VP of Product Marketing / GTM Lead to design a tiered pricing page and clear messaging that highlights the dollar value of the 'errors prevented' and 'latency reduced,' allowing us to easily move from a free developer tool to an indispensable, budget-approved spend for a large company."
rachel@heartbyte.ai,"The pilot with the local clinic went great. We proved our AI tool significantly reduces therapist burnout by automating progress note generation and surfacing key patient trends. But clinic directors are terrified of HIPAA compliance and integrating new tech into their EMR systems (Epic/Cerner). It's not a technical problem; it's a sales blocker. I need someone who understands clinical workflows and healthcare IT procurement to help me develop an entire compliance-first sales deck and integration roadmap that makes them feel safe. I need a healthcare expert who can talk to a CIO, not just a therapist."
founders@forgerewards.com,"The Starbucks app for everyone else. Restaurants lose 30% to DoorDash. We give them a low-cost, white-label loyalty app with in-app ordering to own the customer relationship. The issue? Our churn is too high with the single-location owners. They sign up, they get busy, they forget to manage the loyalty offers. Our tool sits unused. We need a Customer Success Manager/Onboarding Specialist who can design a 'set-it-and-forget-it' onboarding process that gets their first 3 automated marketing campaigns running within 48 hours of launch, so the owner sees immediate ROI without manual effort. Churn reduction is our only priority right now."
founders@clarum.ai,"We've focused on automating the early due diligence (reading 100-page CIMs) for PE firms. We give traceable answers from documents in minutes, saving analysts weeks. This works. The next challenge is, how do we get a small family office to trust us with a multi-million dollar deal's data? It comes down to two things: Security and Enterprise Packaging. We need to stop selling this as a cool AI tool and package it as a secure, institutional-grade product. We need a security-focused Principal Engineer to help us achieve SOC 2 Type II certification immediately and build out the necessary PII redaction and permissioning layer to handle sensitive financial data at a global scale."
jenica@tile.sh,"My problem: The data analyst market is sticky, and analysts are reluctant to switch from their comfortable tools (Jupyter, Hex). My AI-powered notebook is faster for exploratory analysis, but the initial lift for a team to move their workflows is too high. I need a technical writer/developer advocate to build out a killer, use-case-driven content repository and migration guides. I want five clear, detailed tutorials on how to move a common workflow (e.g., cohort analysis from a cloud data warehouse) from a legacy notebook tool to Tile.sh, proving the 5x speed increase in the process. The focus is on technical adoption."

wyatt@halluminate.ai,"Our biggest technical choke point is generating hyper-realistic, high-quality synthetic data to populate our simulators like Westworld. AI agents only learn when the simulation is nearly perfect, but 'massaging' the data (e.g., flight prices, enterprise platform metadata) to be deterministically random and stable is brutal. We need a Data Architect who can build a procedural generation engine to scale synthetic data creation without manual effort."
jerry@halluminate.ai,"We have proof points, but the tasks we train agents on are only valuable if they solve a real economic problem for AI labs. We are bottlenecked by the difficulty of validating high-value, niche enterprise use cases.

Our goal is to move from prototype to $5M in contract-backed production volume within 18 months."
founders@usedash.ai,"I look at the AI landscape and see a brilliant orchestra where every musician is in a different building. The technology is remarkable we have GPT, Claude, Gemini but delivery is the 'last mile' failure. My challenge is not building another great model, but solving fragmentation to make AI truly invisible, democratized infrastructure. How do I convince an entire ecosystem to abandon wasteful, siloed subscriptions and adopt a single, intelligent orchestration layer that just works? The technical complexity of routing intent perfectly across all models, and the monumental effort of changing user behavior, is the thing I haven't fully solved."
john@usejuxta.org,"Our value proposition is simple: location tracking anywhere, with no hardware. Our core tech is synthetic fingerprinting and AI training. The primary bottleneck is accelerating the deployment and model training cycle. We need a Senior Machine Learning Engineer focused on edge deployment to optimize our models for minimal latency on-device and create a self-improving data loop that reduces map drift over time. It's an MLOps challenge for a deep-tech product."
founders@phases.ai,"The core challenge is trust and regulatory compliance in a high-risk, high-impact user segment. We are using AI to build financial tools for a population that lacks traditional documentation, but without a clear, auditable governance framework, banks and partners won't touch us.

founders@opennote.com,"We have strong product-market fit but are stuck in the 'founder as bottleneck' plateau. Every major sales deal, roadmap decision, and escalation still flows through the founders. We need to transition from founder-led sales to a scalable system.

peter@hera.video,"We're growing fast, but our server costs are spiraling because of high rendering/compute demands. Our customers use us to automate complex processes that chew through GPU time. To maintain margins and scale, we need a Principal Infrastructure Engineer to aggressively optimize our cloud architecture for efficient rendering, focusing on dynamic provisioning and cost-effective GPU utilization. We need to cut rendering costs by $20\%$ without impacting user speed."
founders@bootloop.ai,"Our AI agent is built for embedded developers to write and test firmware. The market is highly risk-averse, focusing on security and hardware integration reliability. Our challenge is proving we are enterprise-grade. We need an Information Security / Compliance Lead to finalize and maintain ITAR/SOC 2 compliance and develop a Zero Data Retention strategy to satisfy security-conscious aerospace and defense clients. Trust is our competitive moat."
founders@tecto.ai,"The core issue is sourcing proprietary, verified off-market deal data. Every PropTech promises deal flow, but ours must be demonstrably superior. We need a Head of Data Acquisition and Partnerships to forge strategic relationships with property management firms, local brokers, and data vendors to secure unique data feeds that give our AI models an information advantage over competitors. This is a partnerships problem that unlocks our product's core value."
founders@trychannel3.com,"We're in the AI media space, which means our models are constantly evolving, but our product experience is fragmented. We have cool tech, but users struggle to translate their creative vision into our platform's AI prompts and controls. We need a UX/Product Designer who is also a strong User Researcher to streamline the core 'prompt-to-asset' workflow and build a system for gathering structured feedback on AI output quality. We need to make the AI feel like a creative partner, not a confusing tool."
vihaar@orangeslice.ai,"Our AI tool helps sales teams by analyzing call transcripts and recommending actions. The problem is demonstrating measurable, attributable ROI to a sales leader’s metrics (pipeline velocity, win rate) versus just 'saving time.' We need a Sales Strategy & Analytics Lead to design a controlled A/B testing framework for our clients' sales floors to formally prove that teams using our AI close deals $\text{X}\%$ faster and use that data as our primary sales tool."
jonasm@finto.de,"We provide the API infrastructure for new FinTech products. Our success hinges entirely on integration reliability and developer experience. The engineering team is solid, but our developer documentation is a fragmented mess. We need a Senior Technical Writer / Developer Advocate to overhaul our API documentation, build five clear, robust integration tutorials, and create an engaging developer portal that drives self-service integration and reduces support tickets by $40\%$. Documentation is product."
admin@pares.ai,"Our platform unifies the chaotic, multi-tool workflow for commercial real estate brokers. The single biggest barrier to adoption is vendor consolidation fear. Brokers are comfortable with their 7 separate tools (CoStar, CRM, Excel). We need a Product Marketing Manager to create a focused, narrative-driven campaign proving that our 'single platform' approach doesn't mean 'less functionality,' but rather 'less switching, more closing,' clearly articulating the $\text{ROI}$ of consolidation versus existing, fragmented stacks."
founders@embedder.dev,"We're trying to modernize the embedded development space, but we face massive resistance to change and technical inertia from veteran engineers who 'love the hardware.' They are reluctant to adopt our decoupled, container-based tooling. We need a Developer Relations / Community Manager to build a strong community around our open-source tools and create technical content (videos, conference talks) that proves modern, abstracted architecture is the most reliable and flexible path for future-proofing embedded projects."
contact@trypond.ai,"I started Trypond to help other startups use AI to solve core challenges like resource constraints, customer acquisition, and scalability. It feels meta, but my current problem is the same as the one I'm solving for others: getting the right customers to see the value now and proving ROI on a tight budget. The market is flooded with generic AI advice, and my specific challenge is cutting through the noise to find the founders who are ready to move past theory and implement our targeted, cost-effective AI solutions today to multiply their potential."
arlan@nozomio.com,"AI can write code, but it lacks context. It’s the difference between a textbook answer and a production-ready solution. Our AI agents can't reliably contribute because they don't know the nuances of our customer's massive, proprietary codebase, their specific documentation, or their internal libraries. I'm building Nia to index and enrich that enterprise context, but the ultimate problem is making our AI agents feel truly 'native' to any unique corporate stack reliably and securely and keeping that knowledge base instantly fresh in a constantly changing environment. It's a high-stakes indexing nightmare."
contact@herdora.com,"Our customers are hemorrhaging money because their AI models are only utilizing 30% of their expensive GPUs. They are forced to pay for a dedicated team of $300k/year 'GPU wizards' to hand-write custom CUDA kernels just to get decent performance. My problem is two-fold: first, latency and cost. We are automating that optimization, but achieving consistent, state-of-the-art performance across an ever-changing landscape of models and hardware NVIDIA, AMD, Intel without a single human touch, is the final technical hurdle. The second is trust: convincing a cynical enterprise to hand over their most critical, low-level inference code to an automated system."
founders@async.build,"As an engineering leader, I watched productivity die under the endless tide of small, soul-crushing tasks bug fixes, UI tweaks, papercuts, and migrations. My true problem isn't the big, exciting projects; it's the scaling friction created by this 'keep-the-lights-on' work. We're building an AI agent that doesn’t just track work, but does it: triages, codes, and tests. But the unsolved challenge is getting an AI to be 100% reliable and safe across the full spectrum of software tickets, and earning the complete, unreserved trust of an engineering manager to delegate critical codebase changes to a machine."
founders@dscribeai.com,"The market is drowning in 'AI-generated' content, and everyone has a model that can write. My problem isn't the technology it's distribution and differentiation. We've built an AI that is superior at a specific vertical of content creation, but we face the constant uphill battle of breaking through the noise, educating the market on why our 'X' is fundamentally better than the generic LLM, and proving ROI that justifies a switch from the status quo. In a crowded landscape, finding the clear, undeniable product-market-fit for a high-quality, specialized AI is the focus of every day."
founders@fossorial.io,"We're in the business of 'digging' deep into complex enterprise data providing the low-level, high-fidelity insights that other tools miss. But the core challenge is a monumental combination of integration and trust. Every customer's infrastructure is a unique, messy, and secure snowflake. Getting reliable, low-latency data access from proprietary, on-prem systems into our platform without compromising security, and building the necessary trust with CIOs to handle their most sensitive data, is an arduous, customer-by-customer battle that bottlenecks our entire scaling process."
contact@luminalai.com,"The massive new generation of AI models are too slow and too expensive to run at scale. My life's mission is 'inference at the speed of light' by compiling these models into zero-overhead GPU code. We've solved a lot of the optimization, but the intractable problem is true serverless inference with giant models. We need to eliminate idle costs and achieve near-zero cold-start times by intelligently streaming weights and managing cache a technical trade-off that has plagued cloud providers for years. Getting a 70B parameter model to feel like a simple API call remains a constant battle against physics and code."
founders@useflai.com,"Dealerships leak over a million dollars a year because more than half their leads call after hours and hit a voicemail. We have the AI voice assistants that answer the phones 24/7, booking service or scheduling test drives. But the unsolved problem is human-level emotional intelligence and fluency. My AI must be indistinguishable from a top salesperson it must handle objections, de-escalate frustration, and build rapport. Any noticeable 'robotic' friction kills the sale. We're fighting to close that final, subtle gap between sophisticated AI and perfect, trustworthy human conversation."
nathan@sira.team,"Running an hourly workforce is a quagmire of admin verifying every timesheet, chasing down shift swaps, and managing compliance. We're building the AI-native HR platform to handle it all. The biggest challenge isn't the software, it's the trust and regulatory complexity. I need my AI agents to be 100% compliant with the ever-changing labor laws across 50 states, never missing a payroll calculation or a reporting deadline. I can automate the tasks, but building a system that a business owner can trust absolutely with the financial and legal health of their entire company is the high-stakes problem that requires constant vigilance."
founders@ghosteye.ai,"The truth of modern security is that attackers don't hack systems; they hack people. Our platform simulates end-to-end human-targeted attacks phishing, vishing, SMS using AI. The unsolved problem is modeling human cognitive and emotional vulnerability at scale. It's easy to write a template, but we are building AI that can generate a unique, non-obvious, and highly effective social engineering campaign for every employee, on a continuous, always-on basis. The human element is the ultimate non-deterministic variable, making our mission to close the 'human attack surface' a challenge that is constantly evolving and impossible to ever fully 'solve."
founders@vulcan-tech.com,"Regulation is a massive handbrake on innovation. The process of drafting and complying with new legal frameworks is slow, expensive, and reactive. We use AI for regulatory drafting and compliance, but the fundamental challenge is prediction and interpretation. It's not enough to summarize existing law; we must build an AI that can interpret the spirit and intent of ambiguous new legislation and predict future regulatory risk with absolute accuracy. Bridging the gap between the logic of a large language model and the complex, messy history of human jurisprudence is our most difficult, ongoing task."
founders@mcp-use.com,"The current method of connecting AI models to the real world simple API wrappers is fundamentally limiting. We are pioneering the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which is a new standard for agents to perform complex, stateful, and transactional actions. My biggest challenge is industry adoption and standardization. We are introducing a new paradigm for agentic computation, but securing widespread buy-in from all the major players from the huge model labs to all the new agent startups to use a unified protocol requires a massive, complex coordination effort that is almost as difficult as the technology itself."
contact@novaflowapp.com,"Biology labs are drowning in data, but their analysis is stuck in the 90s. Scientists wait weeks or months for basic results because the process requires a rare dual expertise deep biological context and strong coding skills. We are the AI data analyst, giving instant, publication-ready plots. But the profound challenge is getting the AI to move past simple analysis to true scientific discovery. Can our model not just process the data I give it, but possess the deep biological intuition to ask the right next question to suggest a fundamental hypothesis that even the most expert human bioinformatician might miss? That is the unpredictable frontier."
founders@convexia.bio,"The whole pharmaceutical industry is built on a broken model that is too slow, too expensive, and fails too often. We are the 'AI-maximalist' pharma company, using agents to run everything from drug sourcing to clinical trials. The core problem is the unsolved gap in predictive biology. We can run phenomenal models like AlphaFold and ESM-3, but there are still fundamental uncertainties data gaps and lack of true predictability that only a physical trial can solve. Our team is racing to build the scientific agent that can, with near-perfect confidence, bridge the chasm between in-silico promise and the messy reality of in-vivo human biology."
founders@vernerobotics.com,"We're building intelligent robotic arms that learn new skills in hours, not months, to fill the crippling labor shortages in manufacturing and logistics. I've got the imitation learning algorithms and the hardware. My biggest challenge is robustness at scale. It's easy to make a robot work perfectly in the lab, but how do I ensure it can reliably perform a subtle task like folding a box, 24/7, across thousands of unpredictable, dirty, noisy customer environments? The final frontier is translating fragile lab intelligence into rugged, real-world, production-line dependability."
founders@golpoai.com,"Sora and Veo can make a flashy 10-second cinematic clip, but they can’t even spell words correctly. I dropped out of Stanford because I saw a fundamental gap: AI video is useless for instruction if it’s not accurate and controllable. Our mission is to make explainer videos coherent, accurate, and up to 30 minutes long. My core problem is moving AI video from a spectacle to a reliable workflow giving users frame-by-frame control and technical accuracy, all while making it 45x cheaper than the competition. It’s a fight for clarity and precision, not just 'wow' factor."
jiehua@comena.ai,"We automate the messy, manual process of converting customer purchase orders into clean, system-ready data. My challenge isn't the AI it's the unpredictable chaos of real-world business documents. Every customer's purchase order, invoice, or email request is a snowflake: different formats, low-resolution scans, handwritten notes, and bizarre vendor-specific jargon. The AI has to handle this infinite variability and map it perfectly into a fixed ERP system. The 'last mile' problem is achieving 100% data fidelity despite 100% document anarchy. It's a constant battle against human inconsistency."

My challenge is transcending data aggregation to deliver undeniable, actionable 'alpha'. It’s not enough to show a number; I need to build a system that instills absolute confidence in a user that our AI's real-time, nuanced analysis of a stock's health is superior to the human analyst consensus. It’s a fight to prove the predictive value of AI against decades of established financial intuition."
founders@floot.com,"We're building an AI-native dev environment a system where you can describe an app and an AI builds it. The most difficult thing about building a platform like this is security and model-developer alignment. How do I give an AI agent access to a live, complex codebase and production APIs while guaranteeing zero security vulnerabilities or accidental data leaks? The AI has to be a brilliant, rapid co-developer while simultaneously being the most risk-averse, highly secured engineer on the team. Balancing speed, capability, and absolute safety is my core dilemma."

We use AI to automatically log, tag, and make all media instantly searchable by natural language. Our primary challenge is deep semantic understanding at extreme scale. It's one thing to tag 'person walking,' but how do I get the AI to flawlessly interpret creative intent to find 'the shot that conveys melancholy' or 'the slow-motion sequence of the game-winning goal' across petabytes of proprietary content? The intelligence has to be both lightning-fast and highly nuanced."
founders@risely.ai,"I lived the pain of bad management it kills productivity and morale. Risely is an AI 'buddy' for managers, offering the guidance they need to level up. The challenge isn't building the coaching model; it's achieving behavioral change and enterprise adoption. I need to build a system that managers don't just use but trust a personalized coach that can cut through their biases, gently correct their mistakes, and genuinely transform their leadership style. We’re in the business of fundamentally changing human habits, and that’s a far harder problem than any line of code."
sean@motives.ai,"Sales teams are overwhelmed by data and generic playbooks. Motives.ai is building the AI Chief Revenue Officer, automating the most difficult part of sales: strategy and creative execution. It’s easy to automate outreach, but my problem is getting the AI to generate a non-obvious, deeply insightful, and unique sales campaign that a top-tier human CRO would devise. The AI needs to interpret market shifts, competitive data, and buyer psychology to create the perfect, unreplicable play and then execute it with precision. It's a constant race to embed true strategic creativity into a machine."
founders@qualify.bot,"Commercial lending loses huge revenue when applicants abandon complex 15-page forms. We use AI voice agents to call them immediately and guide them through the questions. My biggest challenge is building true conversational expertise in a high-stakes, regulatory-heavy domain. The AI must have the social intelligence to be instantly trustworthy, the technical depth to answer complex loan-specific questions, and the rock-solid reliability to handle the entire qualification and document collection process without a single error. The barrier to entry isn't just a good voice it's absolute financial and legal competence."
sales@ironledger.com,"In finance and accounting, an AI that’s 'mostly right' is a liability, not an asset. We're building the new, automated ledger system for small businesses. My singular challenge is achieving 100% ledger-grade accuracy and auditability for every transaction, every tax calculation, and every financial report. The messy reality of bank statements, varied expense categories, and complex regulatory requirements means our AI must be an infallible financial brain. It's a high-stakes problem where a tiny error can lead to a huge audit headache the trust barrier is immense."
founders@albacore.inc,"We're building the world's best underwater drones for the Department of Defense. I’ve got deep experience in defense and autonomous systems. My biggest challenge is navigating the long regulatory cycles while maintaining rapid, agile hardware iteration. It’s a paradox: we need to move at startup speed to deliver a capability that matters, but we're constrained by government contracting processes, security clearances, and the sheer capital required to field and test advanced underwater vehicles. The core fight is translating battlefield-ready technology into a fast, repeatable, and scalable defense product."
bishesh@imprezia.ai,"Every CEO has promised AI transformation, but 95% of companies are seeing a zero return on their investment. That's the problem we solve. My personal challenge is getting large enterprises to move beyond 'pilot purgatory' and adopt a true AI-first mindset. It’s not a technology problem; it’s a leadership and culture problem. I need to convince established institutions to stop waiting for a perfect playbook and instead empower internal change agents to use AI to make better, faster decisions today. The hidden challenge is selling a mindset change, not just a model."
founders@veritusagent.ai,"We're reinventing the debt collections industry, a highly regulated and sensitive area, using AI agents, including voice agents. Our mission is to be the next-gen debt buyer. My primary challenge is achieving ironclad compliance and building customer trust at scale. We are dealing with sensitive financial data and highly emotional interactions. The AI must be flawless: ethically sound, compliant with all financial regulations, and yet empathetic enough to replace an expensive, inconsistent human collector. I have to build an infallibly compliant AI where a single mistake can be a regulatory disaster."
founders@b12-labs.com,"Drug discovery is a $2 billion, 10-year bottleneck. We automate the most expensive phase chemistry experiments using AI agents to control lab robots via natural language. My challenge is seamless integration across fragmented, multi-vendor lab ecosystems. We have to build a platform that understands complex chemistry, designs the experiments, and then flawlessly executes them across dozens of different robotic systems (Chemspeed, Opentrons, etc.). The sheer complexity of connecting AI-driven design with highly diverse, physical robotic execution is the key hurdle to unlocking the promised 30x speed gain."
founders@designarena.ai,"The mainstream is obsessed with 'agentic AI,' but in enterprise banking, autonomous agents will crumble under compliance and governance. My biggest challenge is making AI truly useful to banks by building a knowledge-first, human-in-the-loop architecture. The AI must act as a 'digital expert,' able to reason, dialogue with other agents, and, crucially, know exactly when to bring a human into the loop to maintain risk and compliance. I am fighting the mentality that believes in fully autonomous AI, arguing instead for a superior augmented intelligence framework."
founders@fluidize.ai,"I've worked at NASA JPL; I know how slow R&D is. We help scientists and engineers run experiments with AI, automating everything from setup to validation. Our biggest challenge is model generalization and validation across highly varied scientific domains. An AI agent needs to move beyond simple data analysis and autonomously structure, execute, and interpret simulations for a chemist, a mechanical engineer, and a physicist. We're trying to build a single system that accelerates all science, which means solving the fundamental problem of how to get AI to reason and experiment in a domain-agnostic, scientifically rigorous way."
founders@wedge.health,"Healthcare is an adoption graveyard for new AI. We provide the 'Palantir for Health AI Agents,' acting as the operating system for hospitals and health plans. My challenge is overcoming deep institutional inertia and regulatory fear (HIPAA/HITECH). We have to build a platform that is not just secure, but verifiably secure, and then deploy it by embedding our own engineers inside hesitant healthcare organizations. The problem isn't the AI model; it's the change management, data governance, and the legal burden of trust in the most risk-averse industry on earth."
founders@mypingoai.com,"The most frustrating part of language learning is the fear of speaking. We built Pingo AI to be an ultra-realistic, low-pressure practice partner. My biggest challenge is making the conversational AI so natural that it eliminates the user's fear of judgment. The system has to understand nuanced mistakes, provide real-time, constructive feedback without interrupting flow, and adapt the conversation seamlessly to feel like a human tutor, not a bot. It’s an immersion challenge: creating a truly natural, judgment-free environment that drives fluency."
ashwin@contextfort.ai,"The $3 trillion construction industry wastes weeks manually reviewing blueprints for errors, leading to costly rework. We use an AI co-pilot to review drawings in minutes. My challenge is achieving perfect, multi-sheet, cross-disciplinary context-awareness. The AI has to simultaneously compare dimensions, note conflicts, and draft a spec-compliant Request For Information (RFI) across hundreds of architectural and structural sheets. One overlooked inconsistency leads to an expensive change order on-site, so the problem is achieving zero-error vision and spatial reasoning on complex, messy construction documents."
founders@rid.me,"I'm in the early stages, and like most founders, I'm wearing 20 hats: product, sales, marketing, and fundraising. My personal challenge is the resource-scarcity paradox we have a game-changing product but lack the capital to push it to market effectively. It’s the constant mental switch between building a revolutionary technology and trying to secure the next round of funding. Without the money, even a world-class solution feels like shouting into the void. The battle is against burnout and finding those first 10, 'miracle' clients to show traction."
aaron@syntheticsociety.ai,"Look, our research is all about using synthetic data to safely study algorithms and societal impact, but I'm constantly worried that our privacy-enhancing tech is introducing unknown distortions that could marginalize vulnerable communities we need a way to validate that doesn't rely on us just crossing our fingers. Someone needs to solve the 'Does my synthetic data accidentally make me an unethical actor?' problem."
filippo@mobileoperator.com,"I've revolutionized global connectivity before, but the new fight is different. We're trying to disrupt legacy mobile carrier billing, but we're constantly battling opaque pricing, poor conversion rates, and the sheer complexity of integrating with global telco infrastructure. We need a path to 'true global coverage' without spending years on individual provider contracts that are designed to protect the status quo."
ben@useskope.com,"We built a billing system that handles outcome-based pricing you pay when the AI works. The technical challenge is building the billing rails from scratch. The real pain is that there's no standardized, easy way for customers to report back the verified outcome (the secure donation, the completed task) without us rebuilding their entire ERP integration. We need a clean, universal 'outcome-reporting API' that everyone trusts."
founders@lotas.ai,"We're seeing the death of the per-seat subscription model. Our AI agents enable one user to do the work of ten. We need help pivoting to a truly consumption-based or outcome-based pricing model that aligns with the superior results delivered by the AI, not the number of human logins. It’s a complete restructuring of our entire revenue engine."
sam@anytrace.ai,"My whole company is about data traceability and provenance in a world of deepfakes and AI. The market's finally catching on, but the problem is the technology to verify origin is still an arms race. We need a breakthrough in detection standards that can be interoperable across different AI models and platforms, or we're just going to keep building point solutions that get bypassed next month. We need a way to win the detection arms race once."
jonathan@blank.bio,"We're in deep tech biotech, and my problem is the most painful one: our time-to-value is too long for the amount of capital we need to raise. Investors want a quick win, but deep science takes time, resources, and clinical validation. We need an innovative funding/incubation model that can sustain deep biotech for 5+ years before it hits commercial traction, or we'll all just pivot to low-hanging fruit."
satya@getsocratix.ai,"We're building AI coworkers for fraud teams. The tech is solid, but the non-technical headache is convincing institutions to trust a non-deterministic AI with judgment calls. Fraud analysts are drowning, but they won't fully onboard our AI unless we can give them an explainable, verifiable audit trail for every single autonomous decision. We need to solve the 'AI's black box is a legal and compliance liability' problem."
riya@getsocratix.ai,"I'm fighting a trust deficit, not a technology gap. I need an expert on governance, risk, and transparency to help me frame the AI's 'explainable recommendations' and 'audit trails' not just as a feature, but as a superior form of human-in-the-loop control and compliance. We need a playbook for communicating that our AI strengthens human judgment and is less risky than their current manual, error-prone processes. How do I turn our governance into a competitive enabler for trust?"
luis@altur.io,"We're building an AI platform to solve X/Y/Z, but honestly, our biggest struggle is just building in public in an AGI hype cycle. Every small feature is met with 'Will AGI make you redundant next week?' We need help defining and communicating the unique, non-AGI-replicable value we're building that creates a deep moat. We're fighting against the perception that everything is a feature, not a company."
pedro@altur.io,"We need to ensure every single automated call every word, every flow, every text follow-up is 100% compliant with things like Reg F and PCI in the US and Latin America. This requires a dedicated, auditable, and easily updatable Compliance and Policy Engine that sits inside our platform, not bolted on. Who can help us design and implement a zero-error compliance layer that doesn't slow down feature development? We can’t afford a legal misstep because the AI said the wrong thing."
contact@useflywheel.ai,"We're using AI for remotely controlled construction and industrial machinery. The tech is about safety and efficiency, but the customer is scared of two things: liability and downtime. If the AI-controlled machine breaks a wall, who pays? We need a bulletproof AI-specific insurance, liability, and governance framework that the unions and our legal team can sign off on. The lack of that framework is stalling sales."
founders@pharmie.app,"We use AI for pharmacy management, like handling patient calls and document processing. The system is fast, but the moment a patient's issue is complex, the AI breaks down on the multi-turn, high-nuance parts of the conversation. We need a way to guarantee perfect long-running, multi-turn conversational competence so our AI isn't an embarrassing dead-end. The failure state is too high-stakes."
seb@zeroeval.com,"My job is to build the engine behind the self-improving agent. The core problem for us isn't the model it's evaluating it reliably at scale. Right now, running continuous validation on our long-running, multi-turn AI agents is pure, manual friction. The current LLM judges are static and biased, and curating a labeled 'gold standard' dataset for every tweak is a never-ending job."
founders@zeroeval.com,"We're building the auto-optimizer for AI agents because right now, evaluating the quality of a multi-step agent is an absolute nightmare. It’s all high-friction, manually labeled data, and unreliable LLM judges. We need a way to create a 'calibrated LLM judge' that gets better over time by learning from production data and human feedback, so we can finally iterate and tune our agents reliably."
rohan@serafis.ai,"I'm fighting the 'trust deficit' in enterprise AI. Companies are wary of adopting our systems because all the models are non-deterministic they give a different answer every time. For security or financial systems, that's a liability. We need a technical solution to build predictable, trustable systems on top of inherently unpredictable LLMs without destroying the model's performance."
priya@withnixo.com,"Our product is all about X/Y/Z, but the core technical issue is the sheer difficulty and cost of continuous validation loops for our deployed AI models. The model vulnerabilities increase every time we train and deploy. We need a low-friction, automated pipeline for continuous validation that can quantify and track the frequency and severity of model hallucinations across all our business-critical workflows in real time."
abhay@aventindustrial.com,"We're building AI agents for industrial distributors to automate quoting and order entry. The problem I saw as an operator is that all the critical tribal knowledge lives in people's inboxes or their heads. When they retire (and 50% of the workforce will this decade), that knowledge disappears. We need a way to build a 'digital brain' that seamlessly, instantly, and reliably extracts and operationalizes this data from email, PDFs, and whispers before it walks out the door."
founders@cacaofi.com,"We're in the FinTech space, and our challenge is creating a defensible data moat in the age of open models. We're sitting on valuable, proprietary data, but if we don't architect our system to constantly learn and create network effects, that data is passive and static. We need help defining the 'AI-First data strategy' that turns our unique data from a liability into a dynamic, competitive asset."
tom@joinsidekick.com,"I'm trying to lead a cultural transformation to go 'AI-First.' The best AI/ML talent refuses to work on legacy-only platforms, but getting the rest of the engineering team to adopt AI like it's a cookie in operations, sales, and internal tooling is a nightmare. We need a blueprint to rewire our engineering culture, empower smaller, more agile data teams, and signal to the market that we're where the cutting-edge work is happening."
founders@monarcha.ai,"We turn natural language into geospatial analysis no GIS degree needed. The struggle isn't the AI; it's breaking through the entrenched loyalty to legacy, desktop-based GIS software like ESRI. We need a strategy to convince veteran analysts that a conversational interface can actually replace their decade-old, highly specialized workflows. It's a massive change management problem in a deeply technical, slow-moving industry."
founders@cocreate.so,"Our vision is to build a collaborative agent workspace, but the real difficulty is cultural. We're asking teams to shift from traditional project management to trusting a non-human entity to orchestrate work. I can build the best coordination layer in the world, but if the end-user the human team doesn't fundamentally trust the AI's judgment and suggestions, they'll revert to email and Slack. How do we engineer a transparent 'trust interface' that makes the AI's decisions explainable, auditable, and, most importantly, de-risks its adoption for a skeptical enterprise user? It's a psychological barrier, not a technical one."
founders@uselark.io,"We're building the AI-native billing platform. The core challenge is making our system flexible enough for the rapidly evolving, complex usage-based pricing models of other AI companies. Today's model is tomorrow's legacy. We need to continuously adapt our core pricing engine to support complex, high-volume metrics like tokens, compute-hours, or creative-output-quality scores without a moment of downtime or a single billing error. The technical burden of ensuring 100% data fidelity and real-time processing under continuously shifting contract logic is insane. We need help with designing the ultimate 'future-proof' billing schema."
cantu@f4.dev,"My biggest pain point is the brittle nature of engineering data standards. We automate compliance checks for engineering drawings using GD&T, but the standards themselves (ASME Y14.5) are incredibly nuanced and sometimes contradictory across revisions. Parsing that human, ambiguous design intent into deterministic, logic-based compliance is a nightmare. I need to figure out how to build a dynamic logic engine that can interpret subtle geometric tolerancing based on decades of tribal engineering knowledge, not just the text in a spec sheet."
paul@f4.dev,"We save manufacturers from fabrication errors, but getting a foot in the door at a massive, highly regulated manufacturing organization is tough. The non-technical hurdle is overcoming the 'It's how we've always done it' inertia when dealing with legacy CAD/PLM systems and entrenched vendor relationships. I need a clear, surgical strategy to demonstrate immediate, undeniable ROI to a 50-year-old engineering department without requiring a six-month integration cycle."
founders@kalinda.ai,"We're an AI legal research assistant. The single hardest non-technical challenge is the existential threat of better-funded competitors like Harvey raising half a billion dollars. They suck up all the talent and mindshare. We're unfunded and have to be ten times smarter. My ask is simple: How do we carve out an immediate, unassailable vertical niche in legal AI that is too small for the giants to care about now, but large enough to sustain us until we can expand our moat? We need to become the undisputed market leader in one tiny, painful legal problem fast."
founders@usepanels.com,"We collect high-quality, diverse audio data for training foundation voice models. Our problem isn't collecting the data; it's maintaining contributor diversity and preventing 'data pollution' at scale. If our incentives skew even slightly, we'll end up with a huge volume of low-effort, uniform, non-expressive audio that poisons our product. We need a sophisticated, dynamic incentive and QA mechanism a 'Trust & Quality Layer' to continuously monitor for and reward genuine real-world linguistic diversity and conversational expressiveness across 100+ countries."
founders@heyblue.com,"Our challenge is supply chain and manufacturing. We're building a tiny hardware product a USB-C plug-in for our AI. Shipping a novel piece of hardware reliably and on time is a relentless, capital-intensive grind. The complexity of a hardware-software offering is a 10x multiplier on typical startup headaches."
founders@effi-gov.com,"Working with government agencies (GovTech) means everything is political and procedural. Our major challenge is the unpredictable, multi-year procurement and certification labyrinth. Even with a pilot success, the process to move to a long-term contract involves navigating a dozen different stakeholders, competing against legacy providers with massive lobbying power, and winning the trust of a system designed to move slowly. We need a 'Procurement-as-a-Service' expert who understands how to strategically accelerate the bureaucratic timeline."
alexander@ondeck-ai.com,"I'm building an AI-based automated monitoring solution for the commercial fishing industry. The technical difficulty is generalizing our computer vision models to account for the highly variable, rough conditions at sea. Our models need to accurately count and classify fish in any weather, light, camera angle, and on a deck that’s pitching and rolling. Making our technology robust enough for that real-world chaos is the absolute rate-limiting step to scale."
royce@pleom.com,"My momentum killer is context collapse in our team's AI tools. Every employee has 10 AI tools, but none of them share the crucial, high-level context about the business, our strategy, and our customer base. We're wasting time re-prompting and losing institutional knowledge. I need to build an internal 'Global Knowledge Graph' that all our agents can tap into to prevent this persistent, low-grade knowledge loss."
contact@observee.com,"We need to solve the data ingestion and normalization problem from incredibly fragmented, legacy enterprise systems. The data sources are messy, undocumented, and often come from systems that are decades old. Help us design a robust, self-healing data pipeline that can intelligently infer and normalize schemas from hundreds of distinct, proprietary formats. It's a continuous integration nightmare."
founders@vibecodego.com,"The guy who coined 'vibe coding' just admitted it's 'net unhelpful' for a solo founder. This is my biggest challenge: the narrative is shifting against AI code generation for cohesive, large-scale systems. We need to prove that our structured, agent-based platform produces production-ready code that is demonstrably better architected, more maintainable, and less prone to subtle logic errors than raw LLM output. My job is to pivot the product narrative from 'vibe' to 'verifiable code integrity.'"
federico@tesora.ai,"As CTO, the non-code challenge is managing founder focus across multiple micro-SaaS projects. I have the technical capacity to build quickly, but we keep chasing small wins and lose sight of the one big market opportunity that can scale. I need an organizational framework to ruthlessly kill low-potential side projects and align our small team's technical efforts toward a singular, high-growth vision. It's a discipline problem, not a coding problem."
founders@humoniq.ai,"The CEO challenge in the AI space is aligning our organizational culture and infrastructure to keep pace with the exponential speed of AI progress. We have to invest in leadership readiness and a culture that champions agility, or our infrastructure investments will be obsolete before they're fully utilized. Our biggest struggle is a gaps in leadership readiness to embrace AI's full implications."
robert@stormy.ai,"We automate influencer marketing with AI agents. The hardest part is maintaining an 'authentic' human touch in autonomous, scaled outreach and negotiation. Our agents source and negotiate terms. If the agent sounds too robotic or too aggressive, it kills the deal and damages our brand. I'm struggling with the constant calibration of the model's 'negotiation personality' to be effective at scale without losing the required human-like nuance for creator trust."
founders@acrely.ai,"Scaling our team from a few founders to a full organization without sacrificing our intense focus and speed. We need to hire the right first five people, not just the first five available, especially as a small, capital-efficient team."
jack@rowflow.ai,"RowFlow replaces clunky web forms with AI conversations. My one big technical headache is the 'clean structured data' guarantee. Our whole value proposition is that we eliminate messy data. This means our agents must be flawless at handling user ambiguity, conversational context shifts, and non-standard responses to deliver a perfect JSON output every time. How do I design a dynamic, real-time feedback loop and guardrail system to guarantee the integrity of structured data exiting a fluid, human conversation?"
adi@agentmail.cc,"My biggest ask is help solving the chicken-and-egg problem of platform adoption. We provide the core API-first email infrastructure for AI agents. We need the agents to exist to use us, but the agents need our scaled infrastructure to be reliable. I need to develop a community and developer advocacy program that makes building email-enabled agents so easy and fast that it drives infrastructure adoption before the next-generation of in-house solutions takes over."
team@hypercubic.ai,"The hardest part of building a modern infrastructure company is the recruiting game against the hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP). We need world-class, low-level systems engineers, but we can’t match the FAANG salaries or stock packages. We need a strategy to articulate our company's mission, impact, and unique technical challenges as a more compelling career draw than sheer compensation."
sai@hypercubic.ai,"My key struggle is building a truly elastic and performant multi-tenant infrastructure for our AI compute. We have vastly different enterprise customers running diverse workloads (training, inference, batch jobs). Guaranteeing low latency for real-time inference while efficiently batching and scheduling resource-intensive training jobs on the same cluster is a deep optimization problem. The constant battle is against resource contention."
info@elythea.org,"The difficulty isn't building the feature; it's convincing a regulated enterprise to replace a tried-and-true manual process with an autonomous AI agent. We can guarantee the output, but the legal and compliance teams are terrified of the 'black box' and the lack of a human audit trail. My primary non-technical headache is designing and implementing a governance and transparency layer that is so rigorous and auditable it overcomes a decade of corporate skepticism and legal liability concerns in a single presentation."
founders@parachute-ai.com,"My core technical problem is algorithmic drift and decay in our core models once they hit production. We train our models in a clean, high-fidelity environment, but the instant they interact with messy, real-world customer data streams which are constantly changing, subtly corrupted, or evolving new patterns the performance begins to degrade slowly but surely. Help me design a self-healing, real-time recalibration system that can detect and correct subtle model performance decay before a customer notices the quality drop. This constant maintenance battle is where the true cost and complexity of AI lies."
founders@agentmail.cc,"The biggest non-technical hurdle for our API-first email for AI agents is establishing a 'Trust Standard' against the entire security ecosystem. We're introducing a new entity an AI agent with its own inbox into the global email network. Every existing spam filter, security vendor, and corporate IT department views a new type of sender as a threat vector until proven otherwise. I need a strategy to proactively partner with major security players and demonstrate, beyond a doubt, that our infrastructure inherently prevents our agents from being used for mass spam, phishing, or coordinated corporate espionage. Our biggest fight is not with code, but with the established security paranoia of the internet."
founders@closera.com,"Our most pressing challenge is the 'Multi-Turn Context Collapse' in our conversational AI platform. Users have complex issues that require eight or more back-and-forth messages, involving multiple systems. By turn five, the model starts to lose the original goal, the user gets frustrated, and the entire interaction fails. We need a way to engineer a persistent, prioritized conversation state tracker that ensures the AI keeps the primary intent like a complex multi-step policy lookup as the 'North Star,' even if the user throws in a dozen irrelevant side questions."
zane@noxmetals.co,"What's keeping me up at night is the real-time deterministic pathfinding for materials handling robots inside the factory. Our speed advantage comes from software + automation. When a custom-cut metal order hits, our system has to instantly route the raw material from stock, through the cutting machines, to packaging with zero collisions and perfect throughput. The technical ask is an advanced, highly optimized scheduling and path-planning algorithm that can handle hundreds of unique parts moving simultaneously in a constrained, dynamic environment it’s a physical-world flow control problem."
navrina@credo.ai,"My biggest non-code problem for AI governance is the gap between ethical 'principles' and measurable 'metrics.' Every enterprise CEO agrees they want 'Fair,' 'Transparent,' and 'Responsible' AI. But we have to translate those abstract values into a unified framework of auditable data, clear risk thresholds, and deployable guardrails that work across hundreds of diverse models. The challenge is standardizing the language of AI risk across departments from the ML engineer to the corporate lawyer to make governance a quantitative and actionable discipline, not just a philosophical one."
founders@herdora.com,The problem I don't talk about is the emotional rollercoaster and sheer financial isolation of this founder journey. It's the constant internal doubt coupled with the external pressure to project 100% certainty. It’s hard to stay motivated when there is no certainty and failure is always looming.
founders@candytrail.ai,"As a generative AI company, our biggest struggle is model fidelity decay from repeated fine-tuning. Every customer-specific prompt, dataset, or feedback loop we integrate to make the model better for them incrementally damages its generalization for everyone else. We need a robust, continuous evaluation and isolation architecture that allows for hyper-customization without introducing 'catastrophic forgetting' or diminishing the core model's performance."
aneesh@perspectiveshealth.ai,"My core challenge in health AI is the deep-seated resistance to change from clinical professionals. Our AI automates 2-3 hours of tedious documentation per day, directly combating burnout. Yet, a large segment of clinicians views any automation as a threat to their professional integrity or data security, even if it's HIPAA compliant. The key hurdle is an adoption strategy that wins not just the IT budget, but the trust of the highly skeptical and overworked end-user the therapist or doctor."
founders@slashy.ai,AI adoption is stuck in the interface layer. Our pain point is building an interface that makes using complex AI agents feel as simple and intuitive as using a traditional app. The problem is the user experience for agentic AI; it’s too verbose and cumbersome.
hello@pally.com,"Our non-obvious problem is preventing toxicity and fostering genuine human connection at scale. We aim to build a platform for real emotional expression, but the moment you introduce scale, you invite trolls and bad actors. We need to maintain the emotional integrity of our community without heavy-handed, human-led moderation that kills spontaneity."
team@idler.ai,"Help me fix this: we need a way to rapidly, automatically generate synthetic real-world coding environments for our AI models to train in. Our models need to learn from complex, messy, and broken codebases in diverse languages, but we can't use proprietary customer code. The technical ask is an environment generation agent that can create high-fidelity, production-grade synthetic coding scenarios and bug landscapes at industrial scale a 'bug farm' for reinforcement learning."
founders@withkeystone.com,"The hardest non-technical problem for AI foundation models is navigating the geopolitical and national security implications of building globally accessible, powerful foundational technology. We constantly worry about potential misuse and the regulatory pressure from governments worldwide. We need a proactive, transparent public policy and alignment strategy that positions us as a responsible global partner, not a rogue actor."
mahmoud@cyberdesk.io,"What is truly hard right now is the non-deterministic nature of legacy Windows apps under agent control. We automate processes on old EHRs and ERPs. The technical challenge is that these apps break on tiny, unexpected pop-ups or slight UI changes that would be trivial for a human but derail a brittle automation script. We need a self-learning agent architecture that can reliably memorize a workflow but intelligently fall back to a robust computer vision model to handle unexpected, unmemorized events, and then memorize that new trajectory for next time. It's about combining deterministic speed with flexible, human-like resilience."
founders@boostrobotics.ai,"The biggest challenge for our robotics startup is the data acquisition flywheel in the physical world. AI models thrive on mountains of data, but in robotics, that 'data mountain' must be built from scratch by deploying expensive, physical robots in the field. We are constantly battling the cost and time of generating high-quality, diverse physical-world data to feed our models and accelerate our 'flywheel' faster than anyone else."
founders@getcleon.ai,"The short non-sales problem we face is the customer's fear of 'implementation risk' and timeline ballooning. We sell AI agents for software implementation, which is often a months-long, expensive process. Our challenge is to build so much confidence in our AI's predictability that the customer views the implementation timeline as a guaranteed, fixed-cost duration, not a massive, open-ended time sink."
team@withjanus.com,"Our biggest hurdle is the inertia of manual agent QA. Companies know they need to battle-test their AI agents against thousands of scenarios before deployment, but they're so used to manual, click-based testing that adopting our simulation platform feels like overkill or a new overhead cost. We need to drastically simplify the onboarding process to immediately deliver a catastrophic failure report on their current agent within the first 15 minutes to shock them into realizing the necessity of scaled simulation."
betty@trapezehealth.com,"My core challenge in healthcare AI is proving clinical utility and compliance simultaneously. Getting HIPAA compliance is just the entry fee. The real hurdle is demonstrating that our AI's decisions are not just accurate, but aligned with clinical best practices and defensible in a medical-legal context. We need to bridge the gap between technical AI performance and proven, regulatory-grade clinical efficacy."
founders@getkashikoi.com,"The biggest non-sales struggle is differentiating our AI tool in a sea of single-feature clones. We are constantly fighting the perception that our powerful agent will simply be a small, easily replicable feature added by a much larger incumbent competitor. We need to build a defensible moat based on proprietary data and deep, multi-system integration that is too costly and time-consuming for a large player to match quickly."
alex@patentwatch.ai,"The hardest problem for patent AI is finding the 'smoking gun' prior art in a sea of textual noise. The AI must reliably identify tiny, non-obvious conceptual overlaps between a new patent and a research paper from fifty years ago that are written in completely different technical language. It's a semantic search and reasoning problem where failure means a patent is invalidated or a lawsuit is lost."
founders@sembleai.com,"My biggest non-technical challenge is overcoming the internal fear of AI replacing mid-level managers. We need to position our automation as an 'augmentation for promotion,' not a cost-cutting tool, to prevent internal sabotage and resistance to adoption."
hello@specific.dev,"The core technical hurdle is eliminating all non-determinism in the code generation. If the AI outputs code that breaks once a month for subtle reasons, our API's reliability is zero. We need a way to provably guarantee the resulting code is bug-free before it leaves our server."

andy@deeptrace.com,"The core challenge for deepfake detection is the constant, silent adversarial attack from creation models. The detection engine is perpetually one version behind the generation engine; as soon as we detect a technique, a new one is deployed. It's an unwinnable arms race for ground truth."

founders@bondapp.io,"For us, the biggest non-technical challenge isn't product-market fit; it's the sheer regulatory overhead in FinTech. We're building a novel AI lending product that touches on consumer credit laws in every state, and navigating that legal labyrinth without a multi-million-dollar compliance team is what keeps me up at night. The process of getting one banking partner to sign off on our custom risk model feels like launching a second startup every time."
founders@belugalabs.ai,The core technical challenge is what we call the 'Hallucination-as-a-Service' problem it’s getting our multimodal AI to be creatively fluent yet factually grounded when generating new training data. We need it to invent novel scenarios that are helpful for simulation but never deviate into physically impossible or logically flawed outputs. The fine-tuning loops to enforce that specific constraint are incredibly complex.
fernando@belugalabs.ai,"My biggest non-code pain point has been attracting and retaining world-class AI research talent when we're competing directly with the salary and resource packages offered by giants like Google and OpenAI. We're a small lab, so selling the mission and the autonomy has to overcome a massive compensation gap."
sam@cosmic.new,"We're dealing with immense data governance complexity. Specifically, implementing verifiable and transparent data provenance across a federated learning network. Our model needs to train on highly sensitive, distributed datasets, and proving exactly which data points were used to generate a specific outcome is a cryptographic nightmare we have to solve for our clients' trust."
josh@cosmic.new,"Our main non-sales challenge is the internal operational friction that comes with rapid feature iteration. We're constantly releasing new AI capabilities, and getting the whole organization marketing, support, documentation to keep pace with our breakneck engineering speed is a logistical nightmare. It’s about managing organizational velocity without breaking the team."
founders@getprobo.com,"The core problem we're tackling is fundamentally a trust deficit. Enterprise security teams, especially in regulated industries, fundamentally distrust any automated compliance tool. Our challenge is convincing a skeptical CISO that an AI-driven platform can be more meticulous, reliable, and auditable than a human-led process. This requires a non-technical effort to over-communicate transparency."
andrei.craciunescu@riskcube.com,"The biggest non-technical hurdle is breaking the ingrained legacy relationship cycle in the insurance industry. Brokers operate on handshake deals and historical commission structures; inserting an efficient, AI-native platform requires us to completely re-engineer the economics and social dynamics between carriers, brokers, and the end-customer."
sid@trystratify.com,"It seems simple, but my core challenge is scalability in qualitative research. Our AI agents need to conduct hundreds of deep, nuanced, follow-up-driven interviews simultaneously and then instantly synthesize that into a unified, thematic report. We have to maintain the quality of a human researcher while achieving the scale of a bot farm, and managing the cost-efficiency of the language models in those workflows is the tightrope we walk."
pratham@trystratify.com,"The latency and cost of running massive agentic workflows for user research. We require near-instantaneous, multi-step reasoning from large language models to react naturally to a user's interview response, and minimizing the API costs for that level of complexity is a technical optimization war."
founders@besimple.ai,"The largest non-code problem is an ideological one: fighting the perception that 'simple AI' is 'dumb AI'. We build elegant, single-task AIs that solve a problem perfectly, but founders are constantly pressured to add complexity and unnecessary features to make it a 'platform' just to satisfy VCs who expect feature sprawl. We have to relentlessly protect our core simplicity."
stephen@joinhealthspark.com,"My core problem in healthcare tech is achieving true interoperability with antiquated hospital EMR systems. We need to pull diverse, non-standardized patient data into our platform, and what should be a simple API call often turns into a months-long custom integration project involving legacy mainframe systems."
jonah@joinhealthspark.com,"The biggest non-sales hurdle is the protracted 9-12 month procurement cycle endemic to healthcare systems. Our product saves lives and money, but getting it past legal, compliance, and IT committees takes an agonizingly long time, making burn rate management extremely stressful."
founders@bramantebio.com,"In biotech AI, the core challenge isn't the model itself, but validating the in silico predictions with expensive, slow, real-world wet-lab experiments. The R&D feedback loop is brutally long, meaning our model training is bottlenecked by the physical limitations of drug discovery, not computational power."
founders@heynomi.com,"Our most persistent technical hurdle is the real-time synthesis of emotionally coherent and contextually relevant spoken word responses that don't sound robotic or unnaturally flat. Our users expect a seamless, warm conversation, and generating that level of humanistic audio in milliseconds is a massive compute load."
brett@surge.app,"The biggest non-code pain point I face daily is simply product education and user activation. Our product is revolutionary, but because it introduces a new workflow paradigm, users often struggle with the initial setup and don't immediately grasp the full power. It's a UX/onboarding problem dressed up as a feature gap."
dennis@surge.app,"My core technical challenge is ensuring zero downtime and maintaining state consistency across distributed serverless functions during peak traffic events. Our users rely on immediate execution, and any brief service interruption, even one measured in milliseconds, causes chaos and data loss."
anguel.hristozov@clidey.com,"The biggest challenge is the inherent bias baked into our initial training data. We are constantly iterating to scrub out historical prejudices, which requires a massive, non-technical ethical review of every new dataset we acquire, a process that is slow, expensive, and critical."
hemang.kandwal@clidey.com,"My biggest non-technical pain point is IP protection in the age of generative models. We have custom synthetic data, and ensuring that our unique research doesn't get copied, scraped, or inadvertently incorporated into a competitor's open-source model is an existential threat we have to manage with legal and cryptographic wrappers."
founders@browserbook.com,"The core problem is overcoming the default user inertia against adopting new browser-based tools. People are comfortable with their current workflow, so we have to deliver a 10x experience just to overcome the psychological barrier of installing a new piece of software."
konstantin@diffusion.studio,"challenge is achieving pixel-perfect, temporally-coherent generation in complex video and 3D scenes. When a designer hits 'render,' they expect the texture, lighting, and physics to be perfectly consistent across hundreds of frames and maintaining that consistency while allowing creative input is a huge computational task."
founders@keye.co,"The biggest non-code problem is managing investor expectations in a hype-driven AI market. We build solid, incremental solutions that deliver real ROI, but we constantly have to decline feature requests and pivots that chase the latest large language model (LLM) trend just for the sake of buzz."
oliver@fixa.dev,"My core technical challenge was the pivot itself. Going from a debugging platform to an AI tutor meant rebuilding the entire backend infrastructure for low-latency, real-time voice and multimodal interaction while throwing out 90% of the old codebase. That kind of rip-and-replace is always painful."
jonathan@fixa.dev,"The biggest hurdle right now is the cost and availability of high-end GPU compute for training and serving our multimodal model. Every major release is essentially a race to secure more A100/H100 chips, and that capital expenditure is a constant, suffocating stressor."
founders@autocomputer.ai,"The core problem we address is the fragmentation of internal company data and knowledge. Most enterprises have critical information trapped in disconnected silos emails, spreadsheets, Slack threads. We have to build a unified knowledge graph that can ingest all those messy formats and make them instantly queryable by a single AI agent."
founders@openclinic.com,"Our main non-sales challenge in a consumer healthcare model is user trust and perceived data privacy. We have to invest disproportionately in educating users and demonstrating that our data security is beyond reproach, as the emotional threshold for sharing health data is far higher than for any other app."
ashwin@melder.io,"Look, the biggest nightmare isn't the code; that's just solving a puzzle. The real challenge is navigating the sheer density of fragmented, proprietary healthcare data silos. Every hospital system believes its database is a unique snowflake, and getting them to standardize even one little patient metric for our AI to reliably ingest? It's like trying to herd cats through a keyhole while blindfolded. Data ingestion isn't a technical task, it's a political negotiation, and we're always, always fighting that battle."
philip@melder.io,"I hate it when they call our work ""just another integration layer."" It isn't. My core belief is that the system is sick, and the sickness is friction in clinical decision-making. Our non-technical mountain is proving to the physician that spending three minutes less on documentation because of our AI means they have three more minutes of meaningful human interaction with the patient. It's about selling human impact, not just latency reduction."
philip.brewer@melder.io,"Ugh. We spend way too much money on compute. Like, seriously. My biggest tech pain is actually a dollar problem: managing the inference costs for complex multi-modal health models in real-time. Every prediction runs up a bill, and when you scale across a hospital network, those GPU hours kill our margin. We've got to figure out a way to get smarter predictions for less cash, without degrading the clinical quality, that is the technical tightrope walk."
radu@permitportalapp.com,"It's the bureaucracy, man. Just the endless, soul-crushing bureaucracy. We built a beautiful system for automated construction permits, right? The technical stuff is clean. But our actual problem, the one that blocks everything, is convincing hundreds of wildly disparate municipal governments to move off twenty-year-old paper-based processes. No two cities use the same forms, the same language, or the same review timeline. We're a technology company, but my job is 90% municipal lobbying. I'm fighting inertia, not code bugs. It's slow. Very slow."
founders@coblocks.ai,"Our existence is predicated on solving a singular, brutal technical problem: eliminating brittle, cascading failures in generated code. When an AI writes the logic, and that logic fails three steps down the line, debugging is almost impossible. We're building the infrastructure for self-healing, agentic code execution, and that requires a totally new paradigm for how we approach testing and runtime environments. It’s hard."
gokul@asha.health,"The core problem? Stigma. In mental health, even with the best AI-driven tools for access and screening, the single greatest barrier is a user's fear of being judged or exposed. Our non-technical mission is to craft a product that feels so safe, so confidential, and so human that it overcomes years of social conditioning against seeking help. That's a marketing and design problem far deeper than any algorithm we write."
akkshay@asha.health,"So, I'm stuck on data ethics and privacy. Not just legally compliant, but ethically sound. We handle incredibly sensitive mental health conversations. The technical challenge isn't storing it that's standard encryption. It's ensuring that, even during model training or prompt engineering, no human operator ever sees a personally identifiable, vulnerable user utterance. We must maintain absolute zero-trust on the internal side."
edward@sre.ai,"We're an SRE company, so our biggest hurdle is our own success. When you automate half of a company's Site Reliability tasks, their remaining problems get infinitely more complex and unique. So our AI must evolve from solving common problems to tackling rare, high-stakes edge cases, and that constant requirement for non-linear, unpredictable reasoning is the technical beast we feed every single day."
raj@sre.ai,"I've got a people problem, not a system problem. Hiring and retaining the caliber of SREs who can build automation tools, not just use them. The talent war is fierce, and selling an SRE on working for an SRE startup, rather than just cashing out at a FAANG, is my most persistent and exhausting non-technical task. It's all about finding those rare people who see SRE as a creative art, not just toil."
finn@origamiagents.com,"The biggest issue is that people don't yet trust the models to take action in their systems. They love the insights, sure. They like the summaries. But when we ask them to authorize the AI to actually execute a financial transfer, or change a production database setting? They freeze. Our work is a non-technical one: building layers of human-in-the-loop auditability and trust visibility so the user feels safe giving the agent the keys to the kingdom."
kenson@origamiagents.com,"Technical debt is accruing faster than we can pay it down, because we’re building on foundational LLMs that are always changing. A new model drops, and suddenly all our carefully optimized prompts, all our custom tools, need to be re-engineered, sometimes completely. We're building a sky-scraper on sand, and the sand shifts every three months. That’s the real technology hell."
founders@odapt.ai,"It’s a communication breakdown. We sell deeply technical models for climate-risk prediction, but our customers real estate funds, city planners they don't speak Feynman. My core difficulty is translating complex probability distribution shifts and uncertainty quantification into a simple, actionable piece of business advice. We're essentially translators of high-dimensional math into simple English, and if the translation is off, millions are lost."
founders@thellmdatacompany.com,"My pain? The obsession with quantity over quality in LLM data. Everyone just wants the biggest corpus, but we've learned that curating a small, highly contextual, ""golden-standard"" dataset is 100 times harder and more valuable. It's not a technical scaling problem; it's a meticulous, domain-specific, editorial grind to build the world's most pristine truth source for our model."
contact@chestnutmortgage.com,"You know how hard it is to get clean, verifiable, digitized title and lien data from county records? It’s not a uniform API feed, it’s a patchwork of ancient scanners, microfiche, and PDFs from 3,000 different jurisdictions with zero standards. Our technical goal isn't AI, it's building an ETL pipeline through the dark ages of public records. I just want the data; everything else follows."
vikhyath@kanava.ai,"My team struggles with latency in personalized video generation. The technical challenge is to take a user prompt, synthesize the script, generate the high-quality visuals, and render the final video all in the single-digit seconds necessary for real-time marketing loops. We’re pushing the absolute limits of computational graphics and model speed; it can’t take minutes, it must take moments, and that is a brutal, expensive technical trade-off."
smit@kanava.ai,"I'm the one who deals with the real-time stuff. My core technical challenge is reducing the semantic drift during live, multi-turn conversations with our voice agents. The LLM needs to maintain long-context coherence while generating natural-sounding audio in under 200 milliseconds. If the model 'forgets' the first part of the conversation or the audio cuts out, the user rage-quits. It's a constant, brutal battle with latency and context window management."
founders@theoremlabs.com,"We solve hard problems in applied math, but our core non-technical challenge? The sales cycle in deep enterprise. The people who understand the problem (the data scientists) don't have the budget, and the people who have the budget (the executives) don't speak the language of our solution. We spend half our time teaching C-suite people why their decades-old modeling techniques are leaving millions on the table. It's an education gap, not a product gap."
founders@mbodi.ai,"It's not the AI that's the hurdle; it's the human fear of obsolescence. We're building AI that completely changes how teams of knowledge workers interact with data. So, my biggest fight is overcoming internal resistance to change inside our pilot companies. People see an AI co-pilot and fear replacement, not amplification. That means HR and leadership buy-in is 10x harder than any feature development."
nicole@usesieve.com,"Everyone says data cleaning is a 'solved problem.' They lie. In finance, where we are, the core problem is the unpredictable chaos of unstructured financial data feeds. One source calls earnings 'EBT,' another 'pre-tax rev,' a third uses an infographic. Getting our AI to clean, normalize, and link these disparate, messy inputs reliably, faster than a team of analysts, that's what we live for. It's a data-wrangling war."
merchants@zenobiapay.com,"I'll be honest, the biggest non-code pain point was simply merchants not caring about saving money on processing fees. They're comfortable with Visa/Mastercard, even at high rates. Our pivot was forced by the realization that we couldn't just offer 'lower cost'; we had to offer new revenue. We had to change our focus from cutting their costs to increasing their top-line sales. It's a psychology and incentive problem, absolutely not a tech one."
jannik@robot-learning.co,"My life is about closing the simulation-to-real-world gap for our robots. The technical challenge is immense. I can train a robot in a virtual environment with perfect data for weeks, but the moment it touches a real-world object a slightly squishy box, a slick surface the physics model breaks. We're using offline reinforcement learning, but achieving zero-shot generalization from sim to reality, that's the Everest we’re still climbing."
team@sixtyfour.ai,"My biggest non-sales challenge is the data acquisition strategy for niche enterprise signals. You can’t just buy a list of companies that 'just hired a new VP of Operations in the Midwest with a specific regulatory background.' We have to build custom scraping and reasoning agents to detect that nuance from public filings, news, and infrastructure changes. It's a continuous, bespoke research effort for every single customer."
sean@relixir.ai,"It's a new black box. My core problem is Reverse-Engineering the Generative AI Search Ranking Algorithms the GEO, as we call it. We need to know why ChatGPT recommends Company A over Company B. Since these models are non-deterministic and the API access is limited, we have to build a system that constantly tests, probes, and maps the influence of different content attributes on the output. It's SEO, but against a shifting, sentient target."
founders@bitpatrol.io,"The biggest hurdle is minimizing false positives in secret detection. If we flag a common UUID or a boilerplate config as an exposed credential, our users stop trusting us and disable the tool. Our AI needs to be almost supernaturally accurate it must not only spot the pattern but understand the context and intent of the code around it to verify it’s a real secret. The cost of being wrong is the customer's entire security program."
founders@godela.ai,"The core non-technical challenge is convincing veteran engineers to trust an AI physics engine over their traditional, validated simulation tools. They have decades of experience with ANSYS or Fluent. We're asking them to input a prompt and accept a real-time, AI-generated answer. It requires a massive shift in mindset, selling the speed and exploration of the AI, not just the accuracy. Trust is the product."
founders@starsling.dev,"The big core technical challenge is safely achieving 'autofix' across diverse, heterogeneous codebases. Our agent needs to understand not just Python or Java, but the specific deployment environment, the custom internal library dependencies, and the company's unique testing suite. It’s not just writing the correct line of code; it's writing a testable, deployable pull request that a human dev will actually merge."
cheema@hemut.com,"Finding the product-market fit in a space where everyone's already using Excel. My biggest non-code pain point is the cognitive load of replacing an incumbent, free, and familiar tool with a new, better, paid solution. We have to be so much faster, so much cleaner, that the hassle of the migration becomes an afterthought. It's a behavior change project."
luca@kaelio.com,"My core problem is regulatory friction with clinical data access. We’re building an AI operating system for healthcare, meaning we need to touch patient data across multiple providers. Even with all the HIPAA compliance boxes ticked, the legal overhead, the security audits, and the sheer time it takes to get permission to even look at a slice of de-identified data is the ultimate product bottleneck."
joao@mesmer.co,"The biggest hurdle is getting the initial cohort of users to invest time in training our model. Our product is a personal AI assistant, and it’s only great if you feed it everything your emails, calendar, private notes. Overcoming the initial setup inertia and data fear to get to the 'wow' moment is a massive activation challenge. We must make the first interaction feel valuable, not like a chore."
founders@attunehq.com,"I spend all my energy on cultural alignment in distributed teams. Our core non-technical challenge is ensuring that engineers in one time zone and sales people in another, who never meet in person, maintain a cohesive, shared understanding of the user and the product vision. Our company is the product we're building a tool for team alignment so we cannot afford to fail at our own mission. The irony is constant."
founders@labric.co,"Our core technical challenge is real-time risk modeling for cross-border B2B payments. We're dealing with immense volumes and huge transaction values. The model needs to instantly assess fraud risk, regulatory compliance (AML/KYC), and foreign exchange volatility all at once, before the payment clears. A half-second delay or one bad prediction costs us a fortune. Speed and security are mutually exclusive nightmares."
founders@alkali-eng.com,"The biggest non-code pain point is the certification and audit process in industrial chemical engineering. Our AI suggests process improvements, but before a customer can implement it on a live plant, they need sign-off from multiple independent bodies. That validation process is slow, expensive, and opaque. We're essentially trying to get an old, cautious industry to accept a new, faster scientific method."
founders@bitboard.work,"The core problem? It's not the tech. It's the fragmentation of the modern worker's attention. We're building a unified workspace, but every tool, every notification, every other app is fighting for their focus. Our success hinges on being the one piece of software that is calm, non-interrupting, and unequivocally valuable enough to pull them out of the Slack/Email/Jira loop. It's a focus competition."
lalit@delty.ai,"The biggest hurdle is the data ownership debate with our partners. We build powerful AI agents that integrate deeply into their internal tools and data streams. They love the outcome, but the negotiations around who owns the derived, aggregate, and re-trained models not the raw data, but the intelligence are incredibly complex and legally draining. It stifles development speed."
founders@kestral.team,"We're trying to automate the product manager's intuition. The core technical challenge is getting the AI to distinguish between a loud customer complaint and a high-impact, strategically valuable customer insight. It has to ingest all the noise sales calls, support tickets, Slack threads and output a ranked, justifiable product roadmap. That level of multi-source semantic reasoning is a complex orchestration problem."
founders@mlop.ai,"I'm a technical guy, but my core challenge is non-technical: it’s the sheer friction in getting model governance policies approved in large, regulated enterprises. We can ship a fully integrated, continuously learning MLOps pipeline tomorrow. But if their legal and compliance teams take six months to approve the 'model decay notification schema' or the 'retraining data privacy policy,' the speed advantage of our tech is nullified. We are selling trust infrastructure, and trust is bureaucratic."
founders@0.email,"My biggest technical hurdle is designing a service that feels instantaneous and zero-latency, even when dealing with global email routing and massive volumes. We're essentially trying to be faster than native email clients using a non-standard protocol. Every millisecond of delay is felt by the user, and that means we have to maintain a completely custom, geographically distributed network backbone. It's an edge-computing problem hidden inside a simple communication tool."
founders@thetasoftware.ai,"The biggest non-code pain point is the founder-led sales motion for an infrastructure product. Our tool, which provides self-learning for AI agents, dramatically improves reliability, but the end-user (the agent developer) can't advocate for the six-figure contract. We have to sell to the Head of AI, who cares about the bottom line, but we can only prove our value in the messy details of an agent's technical performance. It's a disconnect between proof and procurement."
founders@aviro.ai,"Our core problem is overcoming the 'long-horizon agent fragility.' We build agents for complex, multi-step enterprise workflows. They're great for one or two steps, but by step seven say, gathering data, synthesizing a report, and sending it to a third-party API they get stuck in loops, hallucinate, or lose context. Our technical mission is to create a reinforcement learning layer that makes the agent actually learn from its failures and apply those lessons to future runs. It's about building a memory that compounds, not resets."
founders@oncactus.com,"This market is saturated with AI. My biggest non-sales hurdle is breaking through the 'Sea of Sameness' in product positioning. Every competitor has a 'copilot' or 'agent.' We have a genuinely differentiated product, but communicating that specific value that one thing our AI does that no other does without sounding like a buzzword-generator is a constant struggle. It’s an extreme clarity and differentiation problem that no amount of code can fix."
founders@blueshoe.com,"Look, we specialize in e-commerce performance. The core technical challenge that keeps me up is real-time resource allocation and traffic-shaping for volatile flash sales. When a million users hit a site simultaneously, the latency spikes destroy the checkout experience. We have to predict, minute-by-minute, how to shunt traffic, provision microservices, and downgrade non-essential features without any user downtime. It’s a sub-second, multi-variate optimization problem."
founders@aegishealth.us,"The core problem is simple: the $260 billion healthcare claims denial machine. We built an AI agent to automatically write and file insurance claim denial appeals. The non-technical hurdle is that the human system is incentivized to be slow and complex. We're fighting a deliberate system of bureaucracy and friction that financially benefits from denial and delay. Our technology is great, but our true fight is against the inertia of the American healthcare payer system."
founders@wrkdn.com,"I'm a non-technical founder and my biggest non-technical challenge was, and still is, recruiting and retaining world-class engineering talent who believe in a non-technical vision. The best engineers have a dozen offers. Getting them to choose us means I have to be a master of communicating the mission, the culture, and the future value of the product, essentially selling the dream to people who speak only in code."
win@paraquery.com,The core technical challenge for ParaQuery is getting the industry to adopt GPU-accelerated SQL processing as a standard. The technical work integrating Spark-RAPIDS and building a fully managed service that’s faster and cheaper than BigQuery is mostly solved. The problem is overcoming the inertia of decades of legacy CPU-centric data infrastructure. It’s a fundamental shift in mindset for data engineers who are deeply embedded in their old tooling.
founders@zeonsystems.ai,"Our biggest hurdle is the existential uncertainty surrounding frontier AI safety and regulation. We are building powerful agentic systems. We need to continuously monitor and adjust our models to prevent dangerous 'instrumental convergence' risks (where the AI develops undesirable sub-goals). The technical work is intense, but the philosophical and governance burden is the real pressure point knowing that we have to be safer than what's legally required, just because we are dealing with high-agency AI."
founders@morphik.ai,"CAG latency spikes under 100TB load. Why is L2 cache invalidation so damn slow when we hit the 95th percentile on concurrent writes? The GPU memory allocator for ColPali embedding batching is thrashing, causing the 10x speed boost to look like a 2x crawl. We need sub-100ms retrieval, not this 500ms nightmare. Refactor the ingestion pipeline now, compute costs are burning the runway."
hello@vassarrobotics.com,"The supply chain for our bespoke actuators is a disaster area right now, seriously we missed our Q4 shipping target and the investors are not happy. It's not just the cost, which is criminal by the way, it's the reliability, and building a community around an open-source hardware platform when we cannot guarantee consistent component availability is a total brand killer. We have to manage the perception, people think home robots should just magically work like an iPhone, they don't get the robotics engineering complexity, this is going to be the death of us."
arjun@getapproval.ai,"We're hitting a wall with REGULATORY FRICTION in several key states, compliance teams are absolutely spooked by the 'AI Assistant' language even though the final underwriting decisions are human-mediated. The risk modeling division is demanding opaque, old-school documentation for every single API call and ML outcome, undermining our whole pitch of marginless, AI-driven efficiency. We need a VP of COMPLIANCE who doesn't just check boxes but can evangelize our transparency framework to state-level banking commissions, otherwise this market entry strategy is DOA."
founders@tinfoil.sh,"The TEE attestation process is too brittle for multi-region cloud deployments. Specifically, the remote certificate revocation list management is creating unnecessary downtime during model updates. We guarantee provable zero data access which is great, but that promise is meaningless if a secure enclave fails to boot and you lose five-nines availability for enterprise clients. The secure loading handshake needs to be atomic across heterogeneous compute clusters, otherwise we just sold CLOUD CONVENIENCE that's really an Ops headache."
founders@humanbehavior.co,"Listen, the AI is brilliant finding the RAGE CLICK events and the drop-offs right? But the product teams? They not using the insights! They're like stuck in their old A/B testing ways, refusing to look at the qualitative signal, its a PEOPLE PROBLEM not a technology one. We sell a SaaS that turns behavior into action but the internal CULTURE of our target orgs is too slow to adopt new workflows."
xinan@getauctor.com,"The challenge is scaling the traceability matrix generation without unacceptable token leakage or API cost bloat. The context window for a full-lifecycle BRD or Epic is immense, and we must maintain perfect alignment from initial meeting notes to final user stories. Pre-caching knowledge artifacts helps, sure, but the minute a requirement changes, the entire dependency graph has to be re-verified, causing massive compute spikes. We are facing a combinatorial explosion in validation effort which threatens the real-time nature of the 'Alignment That Sticks' feature. We gotta figure out a smarter graph recomputation method."
founders@jazzberry.ai,"The insurance premiums for our sandboxing technology is INSANE. You try convincing UNDERWRITERS that running customer code in a secure, ephemeral microVM is zero risk when one bad shell command can totally breach compliance. They just do not understand the security model. Our legal team is spending 50% of their time on liability waivers because the market perception is that dynamic analysis means we're HACKING our own clients and that fear factor, it slows down ENTERPRISE ADOPTION like nobody's business."
lennert@airweave.ai,RBAC mapping SUCKS across SharePoint and Drive its a nightmare. The ACLs are all over the place and we can't reliably dedupe data across per-user syncs without introducing stale context for some agents. The unified security layer is the single biggest bottleneck for large deployments. Need a better organizational ACL ingestion protocol that doesn't just rely on Q=sharedWithMe parameters. This is messy data infrastructure hell.
founders@frekil.com,"We pivoted too many times to find the right initial target and now our first product is in market but our sales cycle drag on too long. I mean, we thought we had product-market fit but actually we just had product-investor fit. The biggest problem, the one I lose sleep over, is our CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST is unsustainably high. The LTV/CAC ratio is upside down because our marketing spend is generic and we don't know who our ideal customer profile is truly supposed to be, we should have locked that down before we spent all that seed money."
timothy@rimba.ai,"The data quality coming from the legacy SCADA and metering systems is absolute garbage; inconsistent timestamps, missing mass balance inputs, and units of measure all wrong. Our AI can clean 80% of it, but the remaining 20% requires human intervention and that kills the AUTOMATED AUDIT-READY GUARANTEE. We sell PREDICTIVE COMPLIANCE, but if the input data integrity is compromised at the source, our GREET model results are just a fancy guess, risking HUGE FINES for the clients. WE HAVE TO FORCE STANDARD API INTEGRATION not just accept dirty CSV files."
founders@codefour.us,"I built a fully vertically integrated agency experiential, print, fabrication so we're a one-stop-shop. The problem? Scaling capital expenditure (CapEx) for new, high-tech equipment to meet surging demand without crushing our runway is a constant knife-edge trade-off. We deliver a 'Code Four' solution (situation under control), but the internal finance feels like Code Red."
founders@wavedash.gg,"My vision is a world-class fighting game, but the constant pressure is the balance between legacy mechanics (like 'wavedashing') and modern accessibility. If the game is too niche and complex, we fail to capture the mass market; if we simplify too much, we alienate the core competitive community that gives the game its soul. We're fighting a cultural war in design every day."
ananth@sureformhq.com,"The true product is not the analysis, but getting the customer to act on it. I'm watching businesses struggle with scope creep paralysis trying to build a 'SureForm' for everything instead of focusing on a single, high-leverage pain point. We need to force our clients to ruthlessly prioritize to achieve a 10x outcome, but the complexity of their internal politics is our real integration challenge."
founders@gndctl.com,"The manufacturing industry we serve is at an inflection point, but the software tools are stuck in the past legacy systems, spreadsheets, and fragmented solutions. My biggest fight is convincing a compliance-heavy, risk-averse industry to adopt a modern, vertical SaaS platform that feels great to use. The old guard defaults to 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it,' even if their process is slow and error-prone."
founders@eloquentai.co,"We are tackling financial services customer operations, a highly regulated space where accuracy is non-negotiable. The problem is simple: generic LLMs hallucinate and lack auditability. Our entire business rests on the trustworthiness of an AI Operator to handle complex, end-to-end workflows like fraud investigation and KYC/AML reviews without making a single, compliant-breaking mistake. We need a $99.999\%$ reliability guarantee."
founders@clado.ai,"Traditional people search is broken; it's a frustrating game of fuzzy filters and incomplete data. I built Clado with agentic AI to let users describe the person they need in natural language. But the core challenge now is economic viability at scale. Running hundreds of thousands of AI agents for broad searches is too costly, threatening to make our credit model unsustainable unless we optimize the search delegation aggressively."
thomas.minassian@dollyglot.com,"Building an AI avatar (like 'MarcBot') that can conduct nuanced, high-stakes simulations (like a VC stress test) is a technical feat, but the business challenge is defensibility. If a major tech giant releases a generic, high-fidelity avatar platform tomorrow, our technology becomes a commodity. We must secure exclusive IP and carve out a niche where our unique 'personality' models and interactive depth create an unassailable moat."
paul-henri.biojout@dollyglot.com,"See my co-founder's challenge; the key is the multimodal fidelity and emotional range. When founders are pitching to 'MarcBot,' they need to feel the pressure the interruptions, the skepticism, the dry humor. If the voice, the response latency, and the personality aren't perfectly aligned and believable, the illusion breaks, and the entire high-value training premise collapses. We have to nail the human-like interaction."
founders@sublingual.ai,"The promise of 'sublingual' context understanding is transformative, but the challenge is scaling to low-resource languages and managing cultural bias in our training data. We're trying to deliver AI that understands nuance in minority dialects, but acquiring and ethically cleaning reliable data sets for these languages is logistically and financially crushing. We can't afford to be just another English-first tool."
founders@tergle.com,"I saw firsthand the stagnation in the $70B audit industry expensive professionals wasting 60% of their time on mundane, administrative tasks. Our challenge is to overcome the inertia of the Big Four incumbents and convince mid-sized companies that our 'augmented auditor' AI can truly deliver finished, high-quality work, not just assist. We are fighting a cultural war against tradition and manual checklists."
founders@lightbox.sh,My team is wrestling with the final frontier of container technology: scaling TEE attestation and secure enclave key management across heterogeneous cloud environments. Our zero data access promise is only as strong as our ability to securely and atomically boot our clients' code. Brittle certificate revocation lists and slow secure loading handshakes are introducing unacceptable downtime and technical debt.
founders@gettireswing.com,"We have built the easiest way to shop for tires online, but our biggest headwind is the inconsistent customer experience during physical fulfillment and installation. We rely on a fragmented network of local installers, which means we can't guarantee the 'last mile' quality that our digital brand promises. How do we control service quality without the massive CapEx investment of owning every garage?"
founders@lopus.ai,"My problem is the signal-to-noise ratio in B2B deal intelligence. Our AI flags 'high-intent' signals from social channels, but they're often just noise leading our sales teams to chase cold leads. We must build a 10x better data validation layer by integrating private, first-party data (CRM/email) to confirm the intent, or our platform will quickly lose the trust of the enterprise sales teams we are trying to empower."
founders@bindwell.ai,"Pesticides are failing us, and innovation in agrochemicals is stagnant, yet the underlying biochemistry is ripe for an AI transformation like drug discovery. Our core challenge is building a Pairwell model with state-of-the-art generalized uncertainty quantification. Without knowing precisely when our AI's prediction on a novel pesticide candidate is unreliable, we chase expensive, false leads and waste precious wet lab time. We need to measure our ignorance to move faster."
alex@carecycle.ai,"Generic voice AI solutions utterly failed in highly regulated healthcare. My singular focus is tackling Medicare Advantage's devastating approx 50% annual member churn rate. To succeed, we must deliver a voice AI agent that not only provides compliance-driven information but also offers genuine empathy and personalization to seniors, all while maintaining perfect adherence to HIPAA and CMS rules in every single conversation."
founders@tamlabs.ai,"I've learned the hard way that building an AI product is only 20% coding; the rest is customer understanding and marketing. My problem is the long, asynchronous LLM analysis processing time (60-70 seconds for a full TAM-SAM-SOM report). Users won't wait. We have to redesign the execution flow to stream intermediate results, giving users a first, readable output in under 10 seconds, or they'll close the app and never open it again."
founders@waffle.ai,"We built a full-stack MLOps platform, but our biggest problem is feature bloat and a lack of a clear, single 'painkiller' feature. Because we tried to build a 'Waffle' for every part of the data science lifecycle, we're losing to specialized competitors and confusing our users. The churn rate is high because we're a nice-to-have, not a must-have. I need to be ruthless and cut 80% of the product to make the remaining 20% 100x better."
founders@maive.ai,"We are automating compliance paperwork in highly regulated manufacturing using visual AI, starting with aerospace. The challenge is entirely cultural: winning the trust of the floor assemblers. They see the cameras and AI not as a tool that automates their dreaded paperwork, but as a 'big brother' surveillance system. We must overcome this workforce resistance to process verification or our adoption stalls."
arya@contrario.ai,"My entire platform is built on finding contrarian talent that traditional filters miss. The fatal flaw we're seeing is that our $LLM$ is becoming too aggressive in its filtering, sometimes eliminating high-quality candidates simply because their career paths are non-traditional. We are at risk of a high $false$ $negative$ rate, undermining our core value proposition of discovering untapped potential."
adarsh@sophris.ai,"We use AI to automate error detection in circuit board schematics, but our initial deployment model was a disaster: relying on slow, manual on-premise installation by customer IT teams. The friction of sending zipped files and troubleshooting misconfigurations consumed $80\%$ of our engineering time. We can't scale an enterprise product if the deployment takes weeks; we need a self-managed, containerized solution to achieve true velocity."
hello@cardamon.ai,"Our product, an AI assistant for professional email, is a utility. We’ve nailed the tech, but our growth is bottlenecked because we're relying on purely organic word-of-mouth. I'm struggling to shift from being a fantastic tool to a must-have habit that users happily pay for. We don't have a playbook for turning a free trial into an obvious revenue generator. We are solving a problem, but we're not aggressively seizing the market."
pablo@paratushealth.com,"We build data analytics solutions for the highly regulated healthcare sector. Our biggest obstacle is the sales cycle paralysis. It takes forever to get a new hospital system or a payer to sign off because they're terrified of regulatory risk and data security issues, even though our product is compliant. We are winning pilots, but transitioning those pilots to massive, multi-year enterprise contracts is where everything slows down."
founders@miyagilabs.ai,"We convert educational videos, like those on YouTube, into interactive courses and AI tutors for exam prep. We have the content transformation tech, but our challenge is acquiring a continuous supply of high-quality educational video IP and striking the right partnerships with creators and publishers. Without a robust and exclusive content library, we are just a feature that any large platform could copy. Content scarcity is our ceiling."
founders@infinite.dev,"We’re a developer tool focused on abstracting away the complexity of cloud infrastructure using AI. The problem is we've built a product that's technically brilliant but needs a behavioral shift from our target users the elite developers who already trust their old command-line tools. We're too reliant on engineers discovering us in niche forums. We haven't created a compelling, viral narrative that makes them want to switch."
contact@mundoai.world,"Mundo AI is an AI-powered marketplace for global services, connecting users with specialized freelancers and agencies. Our core bottleneck is the simultaneous liquidity problem we need top-tier service providers to attract high-paying customers, and high-paying customers to attract the best providers. We're spending too much effort on manual curation to bootstrap both sides, which is not scalable."
founders@societies.io,"We help companies build and manage their internal or external communities (Societies). Our biggest issue is that many potential clients still view 'community management' as a nice-to-have, not a core revenue driver. We are struggling to define a crystal-clear Return on Investment (ROI) metric that our clients' CFOs can immediately grasp whether it’s reduced support costs, increased retention, or product feedback acceleration."
founders@splash9.com,"Splash9 provides AI solutions for optimizing visual design and branding. We're growing, but slower than I want because we are stuck selling to mid-level marketing teams. The real opportunity is at the brand and creative director level in major agencies and Fortune companies, but we lack the institutional credibility and high-level network to get in front of those decision-makers who control the massive budgets. We need a 'seat at the table'."
founders@optifye.ai,"We digitalize and analyze factory floor performance using computer vision. Our growth is hampered by the enormous friction and deployment complexity of integrating our technology into decades-old, opaque industrial environments. Every new factory requires a custom integration and on-site training that slows our capacity to onboard clients to a crawl. We have a great product, but a slow installation process."
rohun@dartboardenergy.com,"We are building AI models to optimize energy trading and grid management. Because we deal with multi-billion-dollar infrastructure and public utilities, the level of required trust and regulatory approval is insane. Every contract is politically charged and takes years. We need to find a way to offer our models in a smaller, low-risk, modular format that provides immediate value without requiring full system replacement."
founders@harbera.com,"We automate construction site documentation and project management using drone data and AI. I’m finding that our industry, construction, is incredibly fragmented and still heavily reliant on paper-based workflows and low-tech communication. We need to hire people who can cross the chasm from digital enthusiast to on-site operator our sellers need to be equally comfortable in a board room and wearing a hard hat on a muddy job site to truly understand and sell the value."
founders@triplezip.ai,"Focus your sales efforts intensely on a single, high-value vertical where the cost and complexity of existing data integration (a known ""people problem"") are highest, and a successful Triplezip deployment can deliver a quantifiable, immediate ROI beyond simple headcount reduction. Rather than trying to be a horizontal ""context engine"" for all enterprises, become the irreplaceable, specialized data bridge for a specific industry like clinical trials or a niche regulatory domain."
founders@okiapplications.com,"Develop a strategy to embed Oki's insights into the daily workflows of the individual developers and project managers not just the VPs. If the tool becomes indispensable at the execution level for minimizing friction and optimizing their local tasks (e.g., providing an instant, accurate status update for a daily standup without manual input), adoption will pull leadership along much faster than a top-down mandate for a reporting tool."
joshua@generaltrajectory.com,"To accelerate growth, narrow the focus from the ""modern CMO"" generally to a specific, complex CMO problem with a massive budget such as multi-touch attribution or lifetime value prediction in a volatile market segment (e.g., subscription services with high churn). Proving market-leading accuracy in that niche, backed by case studies showing millions in budget optimization, will create the necessary word-of-mouth momentum to conquer adjacent CMO challenges."
founders@trytrata.com,"Since hedge funds are a demanding and insular market, growth will depend less on traditional marketing and more on proof of predictive advantage. A pilot program offering a ""synthetic analyst"" subscription for a highly competitive, fast-moving sector (like emerging tech or specific commodity markets) could generate a track record of superior performance. The founders could offer a guarantee based on the quality/uniqueness of the insights to rapidly build trust and demand within the financial community."
saharsh@withsurface.com,"Need a deep understanding of the problem that Surface is tackling. Assuming a common startup challenge, one could propose: Identify the one key workflow disruption that the Surface platform introduces, and build a free, viral tool around that specific, high-frequency task. If the small tool becomes a daily utility for the target user, converting them to the full platform for more advanced capabilities will become a natural, less friction-filled next step."
founders@fleetworks.ai,"While solving for both the carrier and broker is ambitious, growth could be accelerated by aggressively onboarding the long-tail of small carriers through partnerships that offer them a tangible, immediate competitive advantage. Specifically, guaranteeing a higher load-to-deadhead mile ratio than their current manual process, backed by a simple, mobile-first experience, will create the supply-side density necessary to make the broker-side product a must-have."
founders@usetwine.com,"A hypothesis is needed on the product's focus. Assuming the product is related to workflow automation or connecting disparate data sources (like the technical tool), a successful growth tactic would be to launch an easy, ""one-click"" template library for the most common integration pain points in a popular suite of tools (e.g., marketing, sales, or finance tech). Making a difficult connection trivial for a broad audience will drive initial adoption and demonstrate the core capability."
founders@automorphic.ai,"Given the technical advantage in efficiency and minimal data requirements, the team should target mid-sized enterprises that have valuable, proprietary data but lack the dedicated MLOps teams or budget for traditional, resource-intensive fine-tuning. A ""Data-to-Model-in-a-Day"" challenge to prove the 10-sample capability in a live, secure demonstration will convert skeptical technical leaders far faster than general marketing."
contact@cleancard.bio,"The biggest growth barrier is a clinical and regulatory one: trust and validation. To accelerate adoption once regulatory hurdles are cleared, they should partner with major U.S. health systems to run large-scale, independent clinical utility studies focused on a high-risk but underserved population. Demonstrating a clear, measurable increase in early-stage detection rates within a prestigious network will be the ultimate catalyst for widespread consumer and physician adoption."
lukas@cascading.ai,"Instead of purely focusing on automation speed for existing lenders, the platform can grow by solving the underwriting complexity that keeps many small, non-traditional businesses locked out of capital. By integrating new, real-time data sources (e.g., SaaS subscription payments, operational data) into the AI, the platform can reduce perceived risk for lenders, enabling them to safely approve a new, high-growth segment of borrowers who were previously rejected, thus creating a brand-new market."
admin@envelopemoney.com,"Focus relentlessly on the ""zero-based budgeting"" community and integrate directly with top payroll providers. Giving users the option to automatically distribute funds from their paycheck into their digital envelopes before that money ever hits their primary spending account mimics the control and psychological commitment of handling physical cash, driving higher success rates and stronger product stickiness."
info@trycrew.ai,"Instead of selling a platform, sell a specific, guaranteed outcome like a 20% reduction in weekly status meeting time for a certain team size. Building a viral template or tool around a single, high-pain coordination task such as automated post-mortem generation after a project failure will quickly demonstrate the value of organized execution and drive adoption within a company's most critical teams."
info@sizeless.co,"Without knowing the product, a powerful growth strategy is to offer a migration or scale-testing service to target users of the incumbent systems. By creating a tool that accurately and quickly exposes the hidden costs or limits of a competitor's pricing or architecture, the company can turn a technical challenge into a highly effective, free-to-use sales lead generator."
hello@silimate.com,"Given the high value of proprietary chip data, growth won't be from open sharing. Focus on establishing the tool as the gold standard for a specific class of semiconductor design like advanced packaging or a specialized type of compute. Publishing a definitive, open-source benchmark that showcases Silimate's superior time-to-insight and design PPA power, performance, area compared to traditional tools will create mandatory adoption among leading-edge design houses."
jason@lifestylerx.io,"Partner with a major primary care physician network or a regional payer that is aggressively adopting value-based care. Shift the success metric from patient adherence to Payer ROI by demonstrating a clear, financially measurable reduction in the total cost of care for enrolled patients over an 18-month period. Proving financial savings, not just clinical outcomes, will unlock enterprise contracts for rapid growth."
founders@alguna.io,"Target a specific, high-growth niche AI-powered SaaS companies that are changing their pricing every 90 days. Offer a Revenue Leakage Audit that uses their platform to quickly scan a prospect's existing billing data, publicly quantifying the millions in lost revenue. This high-impact, immediate demonstration of value will overcome inertia faster than a general sales pitch."
founders@fortunahealth.com,"Partner with large hospital systems that have the highest number of uninsured or underinsured patients due to administrative loss of Medicaid coverage. Position the service as a financial stabilization tool that recaptures millions in lost revenue for the hospital by quickly and reliably re-enrolling or verifying patient coverage, making the platform a revenue engine for the provider."
founders@shasta.health,"Assuming a focus on improving rural healthcare access or data infrastructure, a clear path to growth involves securing a state-level grant or pilot program focused on telemedicine or critical access hospital interoperability. Solving a foundational public health data problem for a whole region (like Northern California) will establish credibility and provide a blueprint for expansion into other rural markets."
ali@vizlylabs.com,"Launch a free, premium visualization tool that directly plugs into and enhances the data from a widely-used but visually basic industry platform (e.g., a specific CRM, a manufacturing execution system MES, or a lab information management system LIMS). By becoming the de facto visualization layer for a popular tool, it quickly builds a user base for the full Vizly Labs platform."
founders@vizlylabs.com,"Problem is time-to-first-value is crippling adoption. Product delivers high-quality insights, but initial deployment involves painful, months-long custom integration project connecting messy, siloed enterprise data stacks. Customer must practically build infrastructure road before single dashboard appears. Acceleration requires transforming data connector experience into a genuine zero-friction, one-click setup for major cloud data warehouses, turning implementation cost center into instant value driver."
naxin@obentohealth.com,"Growth is stalled by velocity of payer and employer contracts and low switching motivation. Platform is an excellent wellness product storefront for healthcare providers, but falls into discretionary budget category. Providers see it as ""nice-to-have"" add-on, not essential financial infrastructure. Sales cycle is long because quantitative, guaranteed financial return on investment is missing. Shift must occur from selling wellness to selling cost-saving infrastructure that demonstrably reduces total healthcare spend, immediately justifying procurement as strategic investment."
founders@runglaze.com,"Company suffers from horizontal market dilution and lack of distinct identity. By attempting to serve general design and software needs across multiple sectors, message is weak and product fails to achieve unique advantage over established, specialized competitors. Result is an unfocused roadmap and diluted marketing spend. Solution requires immediate, aggressive pivot to dominate single, high-value vertical where current platform capabilities are 10x better than existing tools, creating a champion solution rather than a generalist platform."
bowen@disputeninja.io,"Scale is limited by human handling of high-value, complex chargeback cases. Automation is highly effective for high-volume, simple disputes. Largest revenue recovery, however, resides in complex cases that still require significant human review and customized evidence compilation. Operating model becomes expensive and unscalable when chasing large clients with complex needs. Future growth demands evolving AI from generating responses to executing full, autonomous case strategy for edge cases, removing human from critical path entirely."
founders@openpipe.ai,"Growth faces a major headwind due to rapid commoditization of fine-tuning. Process itself is quickly becoming a cheap, native feature offered by cloud providers and open-source models. Value proposition risks becoming expensive wrapper around an API everyone can access. Future focus is not on how to tune, but what to tune: becoming indispensable layer of data intelligence that helps customers select most impactful training data, delivering performance gains and massive cost savings regardless of underlying foundation model used."
john@meetcampfire.com,"Growth rate is tied to high-touch customer migration and necessary change management. Company offers modern ERP alternative to NetSuite, a foundational financial system. Ripping out financial core requires extensive sales engineering and white-glove onboarding for every new client. This human-intensive process limits ability to onboard clients simultaneously. Key to acceleration is massive investment in automated migration tooling and a self-serve system that drastically reduces time required for customer to achieve first financial close on platform."
founders@sola-solutions.com,"Company's AI-RPA solution is slowed by market fatigue and high trust barrier for process automation. Enterprises view it as just another ""bot"" platform, having seen many previous RPA projects fail to scale or break production flows. Initial land-and-expand motion is slow because taking over enterprise workflows requires immense trust. Growth requires shifting from general RPA pitch to dominating single, highly regulated, high-volume workflow like 'insurance claims' or 'legal filing' where vision-based automation delivers irrefutable, audited, 10x speed advantage."
founders@fiddlecube.ai,"Adoption is curtailed by customer hesitation regarding data quality and legal/audit risk. Synthetic data generation for LLM tuning is valuable for privacy, but enterprise buyers are frozen by uncertainty. They lack standardized benchmarks to confirm synthetic data perfectly reflects real production data's complexity. Risk of introducing subtle compliance issues or biases without a baseline metric is too high. Urgency lies in developing and championing third-party-validated ""Synthetic Data Fidelity Score"" to convert risk into auditable confidence."
founders@hyperbound.ai,"System effectiveness is bottlenecked by failure to force adoption by sales managers. AI role-play is highly effective for reps, but valuable performance data often lives outside manager's mandatory workflow. Managers, ultimate buyers, find it difficult to integrate AI insights into mandatory weekly 1:1 coaching sessions. Platform is seen as separate 'training' tool, not embedded 'performance management' layer. Must integrate the Hyperbound score as a required, auto-populating metric in every weekly coaching agenda, making tool essential to management performance."
founders@asklio.ai,"Growth is constrained by massive, fragmented data landscape of legacy procurement systems. AI copilot automates purchase requests, but every large enterprise uses different, brittle combination of SAP, Oracle, and internal tools. Integration time with decades-old ERP APIs consumes most of time-to-value. Necessity is developing a ""Zero-Integration"" data intelligence layer. This layer would intelligently consume documents, screenshots, and emails as if a unified database, bypassing painful ERP integration and making procurement request flow instantly accessible."
founders@gigaml.com,"Company faces strong headwind from profound enterprise fear of AI failure in emotional customer interactions. Platform delivers emotionally intelligent AI agents for customer support, but brand risk of one bad, tone-deaf AI call is deemed too high by large, regulated clients. Current value proposition is seen as threat to brand trust, not cost-saver. Strategy must shift from selling agent replacement to selling AI-powered Quality Assurance and Real-Time Agent Augmentation that proves emotional intelligence and compliance alongside human agents before attempting full autonomy."

founders@airgoods.com,Major suppliers won't integrate their live inventory until we eliminate their data exposure fear.
daniel@gladetool.com,"Free users solve one quick problem and never integrate us into a core, sticky team workflow."
anna@buildtrayd.com,Our sales cycle is too long because ROI proof-of-concept requires weeks of messy data integration.
hello@vetrec.io,"Every clinic PIMS integration is a custom nightmare, making scaling non-linear."
founders@talc.ai,Clients are getting stuck in 'data cleanup paralysis' and never move from POC to production.
founders@docsum.ai,Enterprise procurement rejects us because we lack a clear 'auditability and governance' feature narrative.
founders@tryguac.co,No grocery chain will risk disrupting their live ordering system to try our better forecast.
p@aglide.com,"We are viewed as a deploy feature, not a full MLOps platform for model management."
founders@serra.io,We're stuck selling small pilots to innovation budgets instead of large contracts to revenue leaders.
hello@trykino.com,Our best-in-class AI search requires too much expensive on-premise hardware for mid-tier studios.
dawson@trymartin.com,I am the sales bottleneck; new reps cannot replicate my domain expertise and nuanced closing skills.
team@studdy.ai,"Students adopt it, but institutions block us due to fears of academic dishonesty and control."
founders@itsaffinity.com,"Compliance training is seen as a mandatory cost, not a financial/risk-mitigating investment."
founders@nectarclimate.com,We are stuck in endless pilot projects with sustainability managers who lack buying power.
sona@pincites.com,Every legal client has a unique review workflow; our AI needs a no-code configuration layer.
founders@arcimus.com,Security compliance is a sales killer. Every enterprise prospect spends six weeks on vendor review then demands a specific certification missing. Need method to pre-qualify and accelerate trust building at first demo.
j+yc@respaid.com,Month-to-month contracts lack long-term retention. Need to engineer better annual commitment mechanisms without increasing friction during initial sales.
founders@trytaylor.ai,Product-market fit is confirmed but acquisition channel scaling is blocked. Current cost per acquisition through paid channels is not sustainable at volume beyond initial customer segment. Need repeatable referral loop.
founders@cardinalgray.com,Slow client onboarding. Integrating new bank partners requires custom data mapping and governance setup taking over 90 days. Need standardized API layer for plug-and-play regulatory data consumption.
founders@greenlite.ai,Banks acknowledge tool provides value but internal training burden prevents adoption. Employees refuse to learn a new system to automate processes. Change management is bigger problem than technology.
founders@goagentive.com,Agent-based automation requires too much internal buy-in. Middle management doesn't trust AI to handle complex tasks without human oversight. Need a staged deployment plan building trust over months.
gul@metal.so,Vector database storage costs scaling exponentially.
sankeerthrao@agentin.ai,Core value proposition hinges on high-quality real-time data but latency is increasing with user volume. Cannot guarantee sub-second response times without doubling infrastructure cost.
dyllan@rankai.ai,SEO results take months.
hugo@rankai.ai,Sales cycle is too long. Cannot shorten time from initial pitch to measurable search ranking improvement. Clients lose patience before full compounding effect of optimization kicks in. Need faster initial wins.
bardia@fromolive.com,Founders are primary closing resource. Sales hires cannot replicate nuanced deal closing expertise. Need to codify founders' knowledge into repeatable sales playbook and training engine.
support@kite.video,Video hosting bandwidth expensive; retention drops after 30 days.
team@fromolive.com,Current market saturation high. Differentiation message lost among noisy competitors offering similar AI tools. Unique positioning statement needed for immediate clarity.
abhay@frizzle.com,Initial viral loop strong but monetization weak. Students use feature for quick help but won't pay for deeper learning. Need to convert single-use function into subscription utility.
andrea@notte.cc,Legal review of platform liability is blocking major contracts.
nick@perspectiveshealth.ai,Clinician burnout is a factor. Tool saves time but adds cognitive load of learning new software. Need near-zero friction interface requiring no instruction or training.
founders@alterai.dev,Cannot break into top-tier development shops. Viewed as a tool for small teams not enterprise-grade development pipeline utility. Need clear path to integrate with legacy CI/CD systems.
srikar@alterai.dev,Too much engineer time spent on custom deployment for each client.
kevan@alterai.dev,Talent acquisition slow. Cannot hire top-tier machine learning engineers fast enough to keep pace with feature roadmap demands. Need to simplify development workflow.
derek@acrely.ai,Lead quality inconsistent. Business owners interested in AI CSR but expect human perfection instantly. Manage expectations about AI capabilities important to prevent early churn.
founders@notte.cc,"Enterprise adoption requires shifting legal and procurement teams from existing, entrenched vendors. Sales cycles are not 6 months they are 12 to 18 months because of inertia and fear of change. No clear strategy exists to drastically cut evaluation time or offer a non-disruptive entry point into client infrastructure. Current go-to-market relies too heavily on bottom-up developer appeal but revenue needs top-down budget approval."
hello@okibi.ai,"Conversion rate from free trial to paid subscription is flat despite high feature usage. Customers love product but see it as a ""nice-to-have"" not a ""must-have"" utility. Must bake core capability deeper into user workflow to justify expense."
support@modelence.com,Model deployment latency too high.
support@tryjanet.ai,"Customers report difficulty integrating platform with their specific cloud environment configurations. Documentation is comprehensive but not prescriptive enough for non-expert users. Every integration takes several support hours, killing profit margins."
jerry@deepawareai.com,Market is confusing platform’s computer vision capabilities with simple open-source tools. Need to establish clear intellectual property differentiation and educate buyers on complexity of detecting edge cases in real-world environments. Message is failing to convey unique depth of analysis.
saif@outrove.ai,Outbound volume costs are unsustainable.
founders@lanesurf.com,Scaling is blocked by reliance on manual data labeling for new features. Data team cannot process new image and video datasets fast enough to keep ML models current and feature pipeline flowing. Need automated data ingestion and labeling mechanism built into platform.
nam.nguyen@truthsystems.ai,Proving compliance value takes too long. Existing customers use legacy systems and transitioning their audit trail is a complex migration. Fear of compliance error during transfer is delaying sign-off. Need guaranteed zero-downtime transition framework.
contact@tryshor.com,Retention after three months poor.
contact@getlilac.com,Product is built for a niche within a niche. Total addressable market size is small unless a horizontal expansion strategy is executed immediately. Fear of diluting core focus prevents expansion but current segment is saturated. Need strategy for adjacent market entry.
founders@blank.bio,Initial customer base is strong but vertical specialization is causing slow growth. Product could be used across multiple bio-R&D sectors but positioning is too narrow. Expanding messaging risks losing current specialized authority.
founders@clodo.ai,Unit economics are bad at scale. Cloud compute costs for serving complex AI queries are too high to support aggressive pricing model necessary for market share capture. Need significant infrastructure optimization.
founders@daymi.ai,Feature parity with competitor products is too close.
founders@joingaus.com,Marketing message is unclear. Customers don't immediately grasp platform’s unique value proposition over standard SaaS offerings. Messaging requires too much explanation during sales call instead of being instantly understood on website.
abhijay@nuntius.ai,"Churn concentrated in SMB segment. Small businesses find product valuable initially but don't see return on investment within first two quarters. Need a dedicated onboarding flow to drive faster, quantifiable value."
daniel@nuntius.ai,Cannot hire enough senior backend engineers.
founders@trace.so,Integration overhead with other developer tools is complex. Every new customer requires custom connectors built.
founders@normalfactory.com,Customer success team is overloaded supporting integrations and custom reporting needs. Time spent on support is taking away from strategic account growth activities. Need to automate support and reporting.
founders@preempt.me,Regulatory uncertainty is causing friction in financial services sector. Customers fear committing to platform due to unknown future compliance requirements around AI usage. Need a clear legal guidance framework.
admin@nexa.farm,Farmer adoption is slow due to poor internet connectivity in rural areas. Platform’s reliance on cloud processing is a barrier. Need an offline-first or edge-computing solution to reach full market potential.
founders@datafruit.dev,Data integration pipelines are still too bespoke for mid-market clients. Promises made platform is truly plug-and-play for all major cloud warehouses. Reality is a massive lift for internal engineering team to map schemas for every new contract. This bottleneck is directly proportional to implementation time and cost. Must find way to automate or dramatically simplify initial data connection process.
niek@gominimal.ai,Conversion rate from free trial to paid is 3%.
founders@hyprnote.com,"Sales team struggles to articulate product value to different personas. Chief Technology Officer cares about security and latency. Chief Financial Officer cares about immediate cost reduction. Messaging cannot serve both effectively on initial call. Need clear, persona-specific battlecards and discovery scripts to tailor pitch without confusing buyer."
founders@nautilus.co,"Infrastructure costs for running specialized LLM models at scale are crippling unit economics. Currently, compute expense for serving a single complex query means selling high-margin enterprise contracts necessary for profitability. Cannot enter lucrative mid-market segment until model serving cost is reduced by at least 60%. Engineering effort to optimize this single problem is diverting resources from feature development."
info@stellonlabs.com,"Market perception issue. Tool is viewed as a feature not an essential infrastructure layer. Competitors with limited functionality are winning deals because messaging positions tool as system of record. Need narrative shift proving platform is fundamental, irreplaceable component of client stack."
as@rellingsystems.com,Sales cycle 10 months too long.
support@dedaluslabs.ai,"Customer acquisition is entirely founder-led through personal networks. Cannot build a repeatable, scalable lead generation engine. Marketing channels (paid search, content) have been tested but yield poor quality leads that do not convert. Need a system to generate high-intent inbound leads that sales team can efficiently close without founder involvement."
team@fulcrumresearch.ai,Research reports are too complex for non-experts. Value proposition is clear to other researchers but commercial teams don't understand how to use insights to drive action.
support@withgarage.com,Technical debt is accumulating rapidly. Early choices on data architecture are now preventing high-concurrency scaling. Refactoring foundational elements necessary but estimated time to complete is six months which means freezing feature development. Hard choice: speed of growth versus system stability.
events@nowadays.ai,Getting event organizers to pay for AI tools is hard. They prefer manual human solutions despite inefficiency.
support@givefront.com,"Customer support volume is rising faster than revenue. Team is spending significant time answering simple, repetitive questions about documentation and basic setup. Need to build a comprehensive, AI-powered help center that autonomously resolves 80% of level 1 tickets. This is a direct drain on profitability."
hello@creativemode.net,Early customers are happy but do not refer new business. Word-of-mouth absent. Product lacks a clear viral loop mechanism or incentive structure for advocacy. Need to identify single shareable feature.
founders@getpaloma.ai,"Talent retention in core machine learning roles is difficult. Engineers leave for larger, established companies offering higher compensation and prestige. Cannot compete on salary alone. Need to sell engineers on unique mission and challenging technical problems."
founders@freyavoice.ai,Voice models require too much training data. Client onboarding is stalled waiting for adequate data set collection and labeling.
