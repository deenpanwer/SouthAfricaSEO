This directory contains the implementation of a new website for our automation services, which will be a replica of the Palantir website.

## Project Goals

- **High-Fidelity Replica:** The primary goal is to create a website that is a pixel-perfect, interactive, and experiential replica of the Palantir Technologies website (palantir.com).
- **Content Adaptation:** While the design and structure will be a replica, the content will be tailored to our automation services in Pakistan.
- **Technical Independence:** The new website will be self-contained and will not share any components or styling with the main Traconomics website.

## Development Plan

1.  **Component Library:** Create a comprehensive library of all the UI components found on the Palantir website. This includes buttons, cards, navigation bars, footers, etc.
2.  **Page Construction:** Build out each page of the website using the component library. The pages will be structured to match the Palantir sitemap.
3.  **Content Integration:** Populate the website with the final content (text, images, videos).
4.  **Testing and QA:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure the website is free of bugs and inconsistencies.
5.  **Deployment:** Deploy the new website to a staging environment for final review, and then to production.

## Key Technologies

- **Next.js:** The framework for building the website.
- **TypeScript:** The programming language.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the components.
- **Framer Motion:** For animations and interactions.
