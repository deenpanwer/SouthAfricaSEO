A fresh coat of paint is the easiest way to completely transform a room. This year, color trends are all about creating spaces that feel both comforting and personal. Whether you're looking for a subtle refresh or a bold new look, here are the top 5 color trends to inspire you.

### 1. Earthy, Grounding Greens

From soft sage to deep forest green, earthy greens are in. They bring a sense of nature indoors, creating a calm and restorative atmosphere. They work beautifully in bedrooms, living rooms, and home offices.

### 2. Warm, Neutral Tones

Move over, cool grays. Warm neutrals like beige, taupe, and creamy off-whites are back. These colors create a cozy, inviting backdrop that pairs well with almost any decor style.

### 3. Rich, Moody Hues

For those looking to make a statement, deep and moody colors like charcoal, navy, and even dark burgundy are perfect for accent walls, libraries, or dining rooms. They add a touch of drama and sophistication.

### 4. Soft, Dusty Pinks

Pastel pink is no longer just for nurseries. Sophisticated, dusty shades of pink and rose are being used as a new neutral, adding warmth and personality without overwhelming a space.

### 5. Cheerful, Sunny Yellows

A pop of optimistic yellow can bring energy and light to any room. Use it on a front door, in a breakfast nook, or as an accent color in a kitchen to create a happy, welcoming vibe.
