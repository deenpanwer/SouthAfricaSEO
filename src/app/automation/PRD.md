# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Automation Services Website

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new website section dedicated to offering automation services in Pakistan. The primary goal is to create a user experience that is a close visual and interactive replica of the Palantir website (palantir.com), while tailoring the content to our specific services and target audience. This will be a self-contained project within the main website, with its own set of components and styling, but will leverage the existing Next.js infrastructure.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Primary Goal:** To launch a professional, high-impact website for our automation services in Pakistan that generates leads and establishes brand credibility.
*   **Visual Goal:** To create a website that is a "spitting image" of the Palantir website, including its dark theme, typography, layout, and interactive elements.
*   **Content Goal:** To present our automation services in a clear, compelling, and professional manner.
*   **Technical Goal:** To build the website as a self-contained module within the existing Next.js application, without relying on shared components from the main site.

## 3. Target Audience

*   Businesses and organizations in Pakistan looking to automate their processes.
*   Decision-makers (CEOs, CTOs, COOs) within these organizations.
*   Technical and non-technical stakeholders interested in our automation solutions.
