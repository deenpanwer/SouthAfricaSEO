# Project Context: Trac Digital Marketing Agency Website

## 1. Project Overview & Brand Identity

The project is the official website for "Trac" (traconomics.com), a digital marketing agency. The brand's core mission is to provide strategic business solutions that lead to tangible growth for its clients, focusing on increasing revenue, sales, and qualified leads.

The brand voice is expert, confident, and benefit-driven, positioning Trac as a strategic partner rather than just a service provider. This is reinforced by a series of dedicated philosophy pages covering their results-driven methodology, ethical practices, and deep expertise.

A key promotional offer is a "Free Website Development" service, highlighted via a persistent floating banner, designed to attract clients to high-tier service plans.

## 2. Core Business Strategy & Target Audience

Trac's primary strategy is to attract B2B clients through a powerful demonstration of expertise and a focus on local/niche market domination.

- **Local & Niche SEO Dominance:** A cornerstone of the project is its extensive system for generating dynamic, SEO-optimized landing pages for specific industries within specific US states (e.g., Landscaping SEO in Texas, Gym SEO in Colorado). This is complemented by numerous city-specific pages for a global audience. This architecture is designed to capture high-intent, long-tail search traffic.
- **Thought Leadership:** The site features a scalable, file-based system for both a Blog and Case Studies. This content positions Trac as an authority in the digital marketing space.
- **Service Offerings:** The agency provides a full suite of digital marketing services, including SEO, PPC, Social Media Marketing, Web Design, Content Writing, and more.

## 3. Key Content Systems & Architecture

The project is architected around scalable, content-driven systems, making it easy to expand.

- **File-Based CMS:** The Blog (`/blog`) and Case Studies (`/case-studies`) are managed through Markdown (`.md`) files located in `src/lib/articles` and `src/lib/case-studies` respectively. A `blogService.ts` and `caseStudyService.ts` handle reading, parsing (using `gray-matter` and `remark`), and serving this content.
- **Dynamic Location Pages:** A significant feature is the dynamic generation of landing pages for specific geographic locations.
    - **/city/[slug]:** Generates pages for dozens of individual cities worldwide.
    - **Industry-State Pages:** Routes like `/landscaping-seo/[stateSlug]` generate pages for specific services in specific states.
- **Data Source:** All content for these dynamic location pages is sourced from constants files within the `src/lib/` directory (e.g., `cityConstants.tsx`, `landscapingStateConstants.tsx`), which import data from specific state/city files.

## 4. Lead Generation

The primary conversion goal is lead generation.

- **Forms:** Lead capture forms are present on the homepage, contact page, and all dynamic location-based pages.
- **Data Submission:** All forms use `react-hook-form` with `zod` for validation and submit their data to a SheetDB API endpoint.
- **Call to Action (CTA):** The main CTAs across the site are "Get a Free Proposal," "Get a Free Quote," or a similarly action-oriented phrase.

## 5. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI components. The core theme is defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
- **Forms:** `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `react-international-phone`.
- **Animations:** `framer-motion` for UI animations like the number tickers.
- **Content Parsing:** `gray-matter` and `remark` for Markdown processing.

## 6. Exclusions

This summary explicitly **excludes** all files, routes, and logic related to the `/saphirefans` directory. The "SaphireFans" section is a separate, self-contained e-commerce sub-project running on a different subdomain and should be treated as distinct from the main Trac agency website.
